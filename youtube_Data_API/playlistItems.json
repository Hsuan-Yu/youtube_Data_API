        "title": "The ONLY 2 Tricep Exercises You Need (NO, SERIOUSLY!)",
        "description": "Get 60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/550-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nWhat would you say if I told you that there were only two tricep exercises you need to do? In this video, I am going to show you the two triceps exercises that should make up the bare minimum of your tricep workouts. Not only are these two exercises great for building big triceps, but they are the two exercises that will cover all 3 heads of the triceps fully.\n\nSome might tell you that you only need two exercises total in order to build a muscle group. I disagree. I don’t think anyone should be limited to picking just two exercises for a muscle group because in the case of a muscle with multiple heads or bellies, the functions that can be targeted individually through exercise selection are going to factor in.\n\nThe triceps is a great example of this; it has three heads as well as two separate functions. The first is to simply extend the elbow fully. That’s an easy one. Every single triceps exercise you do is going to put that function in focus. What people miss however is the importance of the additional role of the muscle in shoulder extension, or bringing the arm back behind the body.\n\nIt is here that one head in particular stands out most - the triceps long head.\n\nIn order to fully develop the triceps you’re going to want focus a majority of your effort on this head since it makes up two thirds of the size of the muscle. Consider further that the triceps accounts for two thirds the size of the overall arm development and you see just how quickly this is something that you don’t want to overlook.\n\nWell, as with any muscle, we know that we can stress it via a stretch tension and by also putting it into a fully contracted state under load. For the triceps the stretch on the long head comes when we place the arm over head and apply tension to the muscle. When we talk about putting it into its fully contracted state, we are going to need to get that arm all the way down at our sides and back behind our body as far as we can with the elbow fully straightened. \n\nThe tricep exercises chosen for my “only 2” are going to compliment each other perfectly here.\n\nBig triceps are achieved very nicely with this one two combination of tricep exercises. It starts with a lying triceps extension performed with heavier weight than you might be used to. Too often, people treat this as an isolation exercise for the tris. This is not the case. It involves movement at both the shoulder and elbow joint and allows for the handling of pretty significant loads.\n\nIf you perform the lowering of the bar slowly, you can get a great eccentric stretch on the triceps which is known to be a great driver of hypertrophy in and of itself. Full extension of the triceps is going to occur when the bar is extended at the end of the rep. Just make sure to not allow the arms to drift completely over the body since this will take tension away at the top of the rep.\n\nOnce reaching failure, don’t put the bar down just yet. Take the set to and through failure by performing a mechanical drop set immediately into a close grip bench press with the EZ bar. Make sure to target the lower chest line and keep those elbows tucked tight so you can fry those triceps one more time to failure.\n\nThe next exercise is a variation of the triceps pushdown.\n\nRather than perform a traditional rope pushdown which has some limitations due to the physics of the exercise, we can opt for a rocking pushdown. It is easy to learn once you understand the goal of what you are trying to achieve for your triceps. The goal on any pushdown is to try and keep the line of resistance (the cable or rope) perpendicular to the moving segment (in this case your forearm) for as long as possible during the rep.\n\nThis will make the triceps muscle have to work the hardest and keep the most amount of growth producing tension on the muscle at all times.\n\nVarying your body position in space as shown makes it easy to do that and allows you to most importantly, get those arms behind the body to get that long head in its fully contracted state.\n\nNow, if you want to take your tricep training to the next level that hits every head of the triceps from different angle, there are many exercises to choose from. I don’t think we should ever be limited to just two exercises for a muscle group, the triceps included. But you should at least start with these two exercises to build the foundation of your upper arm growth.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete step-by-step training program that will take your workout to the next level, be sure to head over to athleanx.com and find the workout program that matches your goals.\n\nFor more videos on hot to get big triceps and the best tricep exercises to do just that, make sure that you subscribe to this channel here on YouTube and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "description": "Get 60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/549-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nWhat would you say if I told you that there were only two shoulder exercises you need to do? In this video, I am going to show you the two shoulder exercises that should make up the bare minimum of your shoulder workouts. Not only are these two exercises great for building big shoulders, but they are the two exercises that hit cover all 3 heads of the shoulders.\n\nSome might tell you that you only need two exercises total in order to build a muscle group. I disagree. I don’t think anyone should be limited to picking just two exercises for a muscle group because each one often has multiple muscle head as well as multiple functions that can be targeted individually through exercise selection.\n\nThe chest is a great example of this; it has three heads as well as two separate functions. Some might tell you that all you need is a flat bench press and incline bench press. You are only hitting two of the three heads of the chest with this election and while you are pressing, you are not getting any adduction - another major function of the chest.\n\nIn the case of the shoulders, you have the ability to hit all three heads of the delts given the proper exercise selection. Pressing and lateral raises are the basis of your shoulder training and being able to choose one of each is a great way to build big shoulders. This means that one exercise should be a pressing movement and the other should be a lateral raise movement.\n\nHowever, when trying to build big shoulders, this is simply the foundation of your what your shoulder training should include. Not every shoulder workout needs to include both of these exercises, but a complete training plan will at least build off or include them at some point.\n\nThe first exercise up is the overhead press. Now, this doesn’t have to be a barbell overhead press, but it needs to be some variation of the press. This can come in multiple options such as the barbell press, a modified Bradford press, the z-press, or a dumbbell overhead press (standing or seated without pressing your back into the bench).\n\nThe thing is that dumbbell press is limited by the weight you can clean up to your shoulders to press overhead. I like to perform this exercise with a single dumbbell as it allows you to clean the weight up with two hands and it allows for stacking of the wrist over elbow over shoulder to help with orthopedic issues.\n\nThe next exercise is some form of a lateral raise; this can be cheat lateral or a strict lateral performed normally or with an intensity technique such as 1.5 reps. However, my choice is the cable lateral raise because it allows you to hit the middle and rear delts in the same movement. Not only are you raising the weight to hit the middle delts, you are getting the elbow behind your body top get a contraction on the rear delt.\n\nThis exercise is also interesting because it allows you to put the middle and rear delts on stretch, which is normally ignored on traditional lateral raise exercises. In order to build bigger shoulders, you need an exercise selection that not only gets a good contraction, but a good stretch as well.\n\nIf you don't have access to a cable machine to perform this cable side lateral raise for your shoulders you can always grab a pair of dumbbells. One of the most powerful dumbbell shoulder exercises you can do is something called the cheat lateral raise. This is used with heavier weights than you would normally use on a strict lateral raise. \n\nYou lean forward at the torso a bit which will not only help you generate some of the momentum used to bring the weight up and position it for the slow eccentric lowering, but it will put the rear delts into position to drive the arm back behind the body into extension as you raise into abduction. It's a powerful variation of the lateral raise that will hit both the rear and middle delts without needing to have access to a cable machine.\n\nNow, if you want to take your shoulder training to the next level that hits every head of the shoulders from different angle, there are many exercises to choose from. I don’t think we should ever be limited to just two exercises for a muscle group, the delts included. But you should at least start with these two exercises to build the foundation of your shoulder growth.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete step-by-step training program that will take your workout to the next level, be sure to head over to athleanx.com and find the workout program that matches your goals.\n\nFor more videos on hot to get big shoulders and the best exercises to do just that, make sure that you subscribe to this channel here on YouTube and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "The 💯 Ab Workout (MOST EFFECTIVE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/367-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThe hundred ab workout requires all out effort, but the results are nothing short of amazing if you follow the ab exercises and protocols shown here. As always a solid ab workout should consist of exercises for your upper abs, lower abs and obliques.  That said, even that doesn’t make this workout for abs complete.  In order to round out your abdominal development with a well rounded workout you need to spend more time focusing on the reps that actually count to help you get a ripped six pack. That is what we do in this workout.\n\nIf you look at the main ab exercises that people do in their ab workouts you will see that they often don’t train them hard enough. Sure, they may create a bit of a burn, but if you are stopping when this happens you may be ending your ab workout right before it actually starts to work. Here, the 100 ab workout ensures that you are focusing on only the reps that are going to wind up being most effective. In order to do that, you need to seek out the discomfort in your abdominal muscles and maintain it for one hundred grueling but rewarding reps.\n\nThe ab exercises that you choose can make all the difference in this pursuit. If you are doing only the exercises for abs that you can do for high reps and never think about introducing weight or overload into them, you likely won’t be able to experience what high intensity effective reps feel like. The best part is, you can do this and I’m going to show you exactly how to get a 6 pack by doing them.\n\nWhen it comes to training in the effective rep range, you should start by asking yourself an honest question. When you perform a set of any ab exercise, do you take it to failure or close to failure? Likely, the only reps you feel that are challenging are the final 1 to 3 reps.\n\nIf you do not experience some type of tension overload, eccentric overload or metabolic damage during a set - it can be pretty well accepted that you have not done enough to create the need for your body to help you develop your abs to their fullest potential.\n\nWith the abs workout technique shown here and in this series, you’re going to more quickly tap into these strategies more quickly so that you can start to see your abs pop a lot sooner. The workout works as follows:\n\nPerform a set of the ab exercises shown below to 12 rep failure. Choose a weight that will cause you to fail at or close to the 12 rep mark or use the variation of the hanging ab exercises shown that corresponds to the number of reps you were able to perform of the base exercise during your ignition set.\n\nAfter taking the ignition set to failure, the real work begins. \n\nRest for just 15 seconds as part of a somewhat prolonged rest/pause. As soon as these 15 seconds are up, get back into another set. You will instantly recognize that the reps will be challenging more quickly due to the decreased recovery time allowed. \n\nYou are still using the same load however, therefore your abs are still being subjected to the same external load. However many reps you get after each of these rest/pause increments are all deemed to be effective reps. Each bout should be taken to failure. Accumulate 20 effective reps, even if you’re getting just 1 out at a time at some point, and your work on that six pack ab exercise is complete. \n\nIf for some reason you are unable to complete any more reps on your way to 20, end your set and aim to complete all 20 the next time you perform this workout.\n\nHere is how to construct the 100 ab workout with that in mind.\n\n1. Hanging Leg Raise Variation (see video) - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\n2. Eccentric Power Ups - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\n3. Hanging Leg Twist Variation (see video) - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\n4. Russian Twist and Press - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\n5. DB Drag Planks - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\nOptional: Hands Back Knee Tucks x 100 (static hold ladder - 5 reps with 5 second hold as a Rest/Pause\n\nAll totaled, this will amount to 100 effective reps in this intense ab workout.\n\nBeing that this is a weighted ab workout that uses some eccentric overload in addition to a stimulus that you may not be accustomed to, you will want to perform this only one or two times a week.\n\nThis is just one example of how to apply science to your ab workouts.  If you want to train like an athlete you want to put science back in every workout you do.  You can do that with the ATHLEAN-X Training Programs available at athleanx.com and get started right away on building a ripped, muscular, athletic body.\n\nFor more ab workout videos for the upper abs, lower abs and obliques, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at the link above and don’t forget to turn on notifications so you never miss one when it’s published.",

        "title": "The ONLY “How to Get Abs” Video You Need (SERIOUSLY!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/366-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you are watching this video, you are looking for the only “how to get abs” video you need. In this video, I am going to show you how to identify what your ab potential is the right way to get them to show. You might be surprised at what it takes to finally carve out the abs that you are looking for.\n\nFirst, it starts with the anatomy of the abdominals. You have to understand that the rectus abdominis is broken up into compartments by not only the linea alba, but by tendinous intersections. The linea alba is what dissects the abs down the middle of the rectus with the tendinous intersections crossing perpendicular to the linea alba to create the compartments, or abs, that you see.\n\nHere is the interesting thing; studies on cadavers have shown that 97% of subjects had the linea alba and tendinous intersections make up what we visualize as a 6 pack. 6 pack abs are the most common with extra compartments making up 8 pack abs and 10 pack abs occurring at 1.5% each. \n\nThe important thing to note is that every single cadaver studied had not only the linea alba, but the bare minimum of tendinous intersections to make up a six pack. So for anyone that thinks that they do not have the genetic capability of having abs, you are dead wrong. Everyone has the ability to have abs (as we all have them), it just requires the right amount of body fat to be showing.\n\nWhat kind of abs you have; whether they are six pack abs, an 8 pack, or even the ultra rare 10 pack abs - is dependent on genetics. In short, it is not something that you can control, but you can identify your potential by feeling where the tendinous intersections are on your midsection. As a matter of fact, you can find the top row of the intersections at about a two finger distance below your chest.\n\nSome people believe that they don’t have abs because even at leaner levels of body fat, their ab muscles aren’t showing. Now, as mentioned previously, everybody has abs whether they are covered in body fat or not. However, the appearance of them comes down to training and nutrition. If the body fat levels are low but the abs are not showing, that shouts an answer to me right away.\n\nIn your pursuit of how to get a 6 pack, you are not training your abs properly.\n\nLike any other muscle in the body, the muscles of the rectus abdominis can be hypertrophied and grown with the proper training stimulus. I find that most people that don’t have visible abs at lower body fat levels are not applying the three main methods of hypertrophy to the abs like they do the rest of the muscles in the body. The abs respond in the same way that the biceps or pecs do and thus they need to be taken through these methods of hypertrophy to show prominently.\n\nWith tension overload, that means weighted ab movements and exercises need to be included in your training plan. This can be done with weights such as a dumbbell, a plate, or a medicine ball. However, one of the best ways to do this, especially with the lower abs is by using your legs as weight. Hanging ab exercises are a great way to overload the lower abs using nothing but your legs for the source of tension.\n\nAnother way of applying overload to the abs is through the use of eccentrics. This is one of the most underutilized methods of hypertrophy for getting abs and is one that should not be overlooked. This can be done with the use of a physioball or even a band anchored high (on a pullup bar for example). \n\nThe last driver of hypertrophy is metabolic stress. This can come in multiple forms but I think the most practical way is to increase the frequency of your ab training. The abs can trained every day and I think that is the right way to train them, however, it doesn’t need to be for long. You can get a solid overload and stimulus in just 6 minutes a day and I feature many ab workouts on my channel in this format to make sure that you are not spending an excessive amount of time training your abs.\n\nif you want to know how to get abs, you can do all the ab training in the world and it will be for nothing if you don't get your body fat levels down to where they need to be in order for them to show. The only way to do this is to be in a hypocaloric state and that means to be eating less food than you are now. Excessive body fat will always be the number one reason why your abs don't show, regardless of what training you do for them. So if you want your 6, 8, or 10 pack abs to show; you better get your nutrition in check.\n\nIf you are looking for a step-by-step training program to get you ripped athletic muscle, be sure to head to athleanx.com using the link below and check out our workout programs.\n\nIf you are looking for more videos on how to get 6 pack abs, be sure to subscribe to this channel here on YouTube and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a new video when it's published.",

        "title": "The ONLY 2 Biceps Exercises You Need (NO, SERIOUSLY!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/365-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nWhat would you say if I told you that there are only two biceps exercises you need to do? In this video, I am going to show you the two biceps exercises that should make up the bare minimum of your biceps workouts. Not only are these two exercises great for building big biceps, but they are the two exercises that created the foundation of my biceps training.\n\nSome might tell you that you only need two exercises total in order to build a muscle group. I disagree. I don’t think anyone should be limited to picking just two exercises for a muscle group because each one often has multiple muscle heads as well as multiple functions that can be targeted individually through exercise selection.\n\nThe chest is a great example of this; it has three heads as well as two separate functions. Some might tell you that all you need is a flat bench press and an incline bench press. You are only hitting two of the three heads of the chest with this selection and while you are pressing, you are not getting any adduction - another major function of the chest.\n\nWith the biceps, you have three major functions: supination of the forearm, elbow flexion and shoulder flexion. However, you are able to attack all three functions with just about any biceps exercise you do, since they are all a version of a curl. This means that you are not required to have a whole range of exercises, unless you are ready to take you biceps training to the next level.\n\nBut in the case of needing two exercises to build big biceps, this is simply what the absolute foundation of your biceps training should include. Not every single biceps workout needs to include both of these exercises, but a complete training plan will at least build off or include them at some point. As a matter of fact, these two biceps exercises were staples in my early training that helped me to build the big arms that I have today. \n\nThe first exercise up is the strict curl / cheat curl drop set. This is simple, stand with your back, butt, and head against the wall and curl the weight up without losing contact with the wall at any of these points of contact. Perform these curls to failure and then immediately step away from the wall. Here, you are to perform a set of cheat curls, allowing for a little momentum and cheat to get the weight up. Be mindful of the eccentric portion of the lift, however. You will want to lower the weight slow and controlled to get the most benefits out of the exercise.\n\nThis drop set combination is great for building big biceps because you are able to overload the muscles with heavier weight in both portions of the lift. Not only that, but the ability to take an exercise to and through failure is a key component to new muscle growth. \n\nThe next exercise requires nothing but a pullup bar and your own bodyweight. This is something I did fro ma very young age and I think was a major factor in the development of my biceps. The exercise is simply to flex your arms while holding the bar and sticking your head forward so that the back of your head is in front of the pullup bar. This will make sure that you are not only in elbow flexion and forearm supination, but you are getting shoulder flexion as well.\n\nSo what do you do from this position? Well, in order to build bigger biceps you can simply flex and hold there as long as possible and fight the negative. Fight the descent of your body through the entirety of the movement. The key here is to make sure that you are keeping an open angle, about 90 degrees, on your arms while holding the bar.\n\nSimilar to performing a chin-up, you don’t want to close the gap between your biceps and your forearms as you will start to activate your lats, which is something you want to avoid if you are looking to isolate and build big biceps.\n\nNow, if you want to take your biceps training to the next level that hits every function of the biceps as well as targets the muscle from different angles, there are many exercises to choose from. I don’t think we should ever be limited to just two exercises for a muscle group, the biceps included. But you should at least start with these two exercises to build the foundation of your biceps growth.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete step-by-step training program that will take your workouts to the next level, be sure to head over to athleanx.com and find the workout program that matches your goals.\n\nFor more videos on how to get big biceps and the best exercises to do just that, make sure you to subscribe to this channel here on YouTube and remember to turn on notifications so that you never miss a new video when it's published.",

        "title": "Bruce Lee Training (SECRETS REVEALED!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/364-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wanted to train like Bruce Lee? In this video, I am going to show you five core principles pertaining to the Bruce Lee workout and diet plan that helped to make him a lasting fitness icon so that you can implement them into your own workouts and meal plan.\n\nThe first principle of training like Bruce Lee is to lift what can be lifted. What this means is that you should have command and control of the weight through space. How can this command and control be displayed? Easily, actually. If you cannot stop the weight from moving at any point through the range of motion, then the weight is too heavy. For example, can you stop a dumbbell at point during a front raise? Or is the dumbbell so heavy that momentum is carrying it through the range of motion? Bruce Lee was a master of this and translated this demand of command and control into his martial arts practices as well.\n\nThe second principle to train like the legendary Bruce Lee is contraction creates command. By contracting the muscles following an exercise, there is an opportunity to create a greater mind-muscle connection. With a greater link between the two, you will have greater command over the muscles themselves in their pursuit of growth. Bruce Lee famously did this with pushups where, following a set, he would cross his arms and flex his chest. The good thing is that this can be done with almost any exercise and corresponding muscle group. For example, following a set of curls you would flex your biceps, or lat pulldowns; you would be flexing your back. Apply this technique to your training and see for yourself how you create a better mind-muscle connection to lead to further muscle growth than you previously thought.\n\nBruce Lee’s third training principle was to create strength by not losing strength. You’ve likely heard me say in the past that to improve performance on an exercise, you have to plug the energy leaks. Bruce Lee had a very similar approach to his training and workouts. This was displayed with his famous fingertip pushups - without creating rigidity and stability throughout the body, the exercise would be near impossible to perform. But this principle applies to more than just fingertip pushups; plugging the energy leaks can be done on so many exercises in so many forms.\n\nAnother application of creating strength was Bruce Lee’s inclusion of overcoming isometrics. He commonly did this on the bench press and the squat by pressing the bar against the pins of the rack so that the bar would move no further. Overcoming isometrics is a time-tested lifting technique that has helped to produce great strength results and is something you should look to include in your workouts as well.\n\nTo train like Bruce Lee, you have to understand his philosophy on food; being that you are what you eat. Bruce Lee was very conscious of the food that he put in his body and took great care to make sure that he was putting high quality, nutritious food into his system. He famously had an industrial juicer in his home, something unheard of at the time, to help prepare his meals. Bruce also understood the importance of including high quality protein in his meal diet as well. Taking care of what he ate and what he put into his body helped create the body that he sported and the performance to go along with it. I, myself, can’t stress the importance of high quality nutrition if you want to achieve the body you are looking for. Aesthetics or performance, it doesn’t matter; they are going too heavily rely on the food you eat.\n\nThe last principle of Bruce Lee’s training and workouts is that your abs should be like steel. While some might focus on their abs solely for appearance, Bruce Lee felt that the core was important for his martial arts performance as well. Thus, he focused on resilience and rigidity in his ab training. One ab exercise that Bruce Lee was famous for performing was the dragon flag, but if that move is too advanced, you can achieve similar results with exercises like the step out and plate drags. In this training principle, it’s important to take note of the obliques, but being able to train them with overload is even better. This can be done easily by hanging from a bar and performing oblique focused exercises there. \n\nIf you are looking for a program that will get you looking ripped and athletic like Bruce Lee and puts his training principles into effect, then head on over to athleanx.com via the link below and be sure to check out instant access to all 42 workout programs.\n\nFor more videos on workouts and diets like Bruce Lee’s, be sure to subscribe to this channel here on YouTube using the link below and make sure to turn to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "Quad Exercises Ranked (BEST TO WORST!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/363-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThere are so many quad exercises, but which ones should you be focusing your efforts on if you want to build bigger quads and increase your strength? In this video, I’m going to give you the most popular quad exercises ranked from worst to best and help you to determine which you should be doing and which you can probably ditch.\n\nWith that said, we have to lay out the criteria for the quad exercise selections. These are in the video.\n\nFurthermore, if there is a steep learning curve to the movement or it is too equipment reliant then it may mot rank as high as some other options that are better and also don’t require as many resources.\n\nWith that being said, we start laying out the list and work our way up the rankings from the worst chest exercise to the best chest exercise.\n\nWORST\n1. Sissy Squat\n2. Smith Machine Squats\n\nThe sissy squat is one of the better exercises you can do to strengthen the tendons in your knees given the proper progression, but it is a weak exercise choice for trying to build to quads. The lack of overload in this exercise is one of the biggest drawbacks for creating hypertrophy. \n\nThe smith machine squat is probably the worst version of a squat you can do. The fixed nature of the movement does not allow for an individual’s proper biomechanics to come into play. Angled or straight, you’re better off avoiding this version of the squat if you can\n\nBETTER\n3. Drop Squats\n4. Goblet Squats\n5. Heavy Resistance Bike (Hill Riding)\n6. Leg Extensions\n\nDrop squats are great for learning the proper mechanics of a squat, but do are limited in the ability to sufficiently load the exercise.\n\nGoblet squats are great for a more metabolic pursuit of hypertrophy but the limit in load based on available weight as well as your thoracic mobility / strength will play a limiting factor into the exercise as well.\n\nYou’d be hard pressed to find a serious cycler without large quads. Make sure to crank up the resistance and keep consistent with your efforts to see the most gains.\n\nLeg extensions have the ability to directly isolate the quads, but if you have existing knee issues, this exercise could simply make them worse.\n\nBETTER STILL\n7. Leg Press (Feet Low)\n8. DB Step Ups\n9. Sled Push / Pull\n10. DB Spanish Squats / TKE Split Squats\n\nThe leg press allows you to use some heavy weight, but you have to make sure that you are going through the full range of motion to get the most benefits out of the exercise.\n\nDB step ups are a great choice for an eccentric focus on the quads, but you might be challenged on the amount of weight you can use as well as your balance.\n\nThe sled push and pull are excellent options for athletes looking to grow their quads without a focus on the eccentric, but you’ll have to have to access to a sled and enough surface area to use it.\n\nThe Spanish squat and TKE split squat are the perfect replacement for the leg extensions but allow assistance muscles to work in concert as well.\n\nALMOST BEST\n11. Hack Squats\n12. Bulgarian Split Squats\n13. High Bar Back Squats\n14. DB / BB Reverse Lunge\n\nThe hack squat takes the smith machine squat and makes it better by allowing for the body to move naturally even within a fixed path.\n\nBulgarian split squats are one of my favorite quad exercises that can be loaded heavy and challenges one leg at a time to combat muscle imbalances.\n\nThe high bar back squat is the king of all leg exercises and allows for significant overload, but believe it or not, you can better target the quads.\n\nI love the reverse lunge for the ability to overload as well as how it feels for someone with knee problems.\n\nBEST\n15. Front Squats\n16. Belt Squats\n\nThere simply is no better quad exercise for building big quads than the front squat. The ability to overload the exercise and it’s direct targeting of the quads makes it a top choice for building the quads.\n\nThe belt squat is one option that I put directly with the front squat in the best category and shouldn’t be ignored if you have access to it.\n\nFor a complete step by step workout program that was created with the same level of science behind the selection of every exercise in the plans, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below and check out our workout programs designed to get you to reach your goals. \n\nFor more videos on exercises for a bigger quads and the leg workouts / quad exercises be sure to remember to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "6% Body Fat is Ideal For Men (HARSH TRUTH!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/362-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wondered what the ideal body fat percentage for men is? If so, then you are definitely going to want to watch this video. In this one, I am going to discuss what I think is the ideal body fat percentage for men and whether or not that is achievable for you to get to as well as maintain that as well.\n\nIn today’s AX Jeff, Jesse and I are going to discuss a comment that was left on one of my videos regarding body fat. While the commenter seems to think that I’ve said that 6% body fat is the ideal spot to be in for men, especially in comparison to the 15% that was attributed to others, I’ve never actually stated that. I myself am extremely lean with a body fat percentage around 6 or 7%, but do I think that everyone can and should be at the same level of leanness as me? Well, no.\n\nI understand that being as lean as Jeff Cavaliere is a goal for some, but not the goal for everyone and that’s okay. Let’s start with figuring out what your goal is and that comes with identifying whether you are looking at aesthetics, athletics / performance, strength, or in the case of Jesse; all the above.\n\nFor athletics / performance, your body fat levels should be determined by the demands of your sport. But even within the same sport, different positions will have different requirements. In the case of football, a wide receiver is going to need to be at a lower body fat percentage in order to perform at the highest level compared to an offensive lineman who is try to carry as much size as possible to prevent being run over by the defense. Depending on the sport and the position, the idea that lower body fat leads to compromised athletic performance is nonsense.\n\nWhen it comes to strength, we’ve all heard the notion that you need to carry as much weight on their body as possible to move heavy weight on the bar. This often comes with a bulk and cut - adding as much size to your frame as possible to move as much weight as you can in order to grow via overload. After that, cut back down to a level of leanness that is desirable. I will tell you right now, you can still be strong without bulking. You can be lean and strong. Jesse is living proof of this with his deadlift at 550 lbs and his squat over 400 lbs while remaining fairly lean.\n\nWhen it comes to aesthetics, there are 3 important things to take note of. First, is that we should be describing leanness in percentages instead of using terminology. Ripped, shredded, lean, and diced all could mean different things to different people - at least with percentages there is an objective view that all can agree on. \n\nSecond, the leaner you are, the more muscular you will appear. Lower levels of body fat will show more definition, giving the appearance of greater muscularity. Take a look at Bruce Lee, someone considered a fitness icon, and his muscularity. He was not a large individual, but he was very lean which made his muscles appear larger. If he added body fat, inversely he would be considered to be skinny.\n\nThirdly, while subjectivity rules here, I can safely say that 9-10% body fat percentage looks better than 15-17%. The definition and muscularity are going to be enhanced at the lower levels of body fat, creating the appearance of more muscle. If aesthetics is part of the goal, then having a lower body fat level, such as 10% is likely where you are going to want to be.\n\nAs I have said previously, body fat levels as low as mine which is in the 6-7% range, is not for everyone. In fact, I would argue that while most people can get to this level of leanness, a large percentage of people won’t be able to maintain it. Why? Our bodies have a set point at which we are able to comfortable remain at a lower body fat level. Some people simply cannot get past a certain body fat percentage and others can, but feel the side effects of it.\n\nThe idea is to find your set point; the lowest you can get to and maintain it in a healthy manner without any negative side effects. Once you find your set point, you know exactly how lean you can get and maintain year round with the proper discipline.\n\nIf you are looking for a day-by-day meal plan to go along with your workouts to help you get lean and athletic, they are included with every workout program I designed that can be found at the ATHLEAN-X website via the link below.\n\nFor more videos on nutrition and building muscle, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube using the link below and make sure to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a new video when it's published.",

        "title": "How to Fix Upper Back Pain (NO MORE KNOTS!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/361-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wondered how to fix upper back pain? You know, that spot on your back where it feels like you have knots for days. In this video, I am going to breakdown why you are experiencing upper back pain and 5 moves you can do to fix it for good. There is no need to live in chronic pain when there’s a solution that will have your back feeling better right away.\n\nMore often than not, when it comes to pain in the upper back, it doesn’t have to do with the muscles in the area (the rhomboids). Instead it has more to do with the joints in the area and that is namely the thoracic spine. When there is a dysfunction in the thoracic spine, you will often feel it in the surrounding muscles, but because they are not the root cause, we aren’t going to be targeting them directly. Instead, the brunt of our focus for this video will be on mobilizing the thoracic spine.\n\nThe first move that you can do to deal with your upper back pain is called the rhomboid pushup. While not actually targeting the muscles in terms of strengthening them, they are active throughout the mobilization of the thoracic spine. By allowing your chest to drop down towards the ground, you are contracting the muscles through their range of motion and as you protract to reach the top end of the pushup, you are placing them on stretch. Taking these muscles along for the ride as you move the thoracic spine will be the first step in eliminating that pain in the upper back.\n\nNext, you are going to need to stand close to a wall and perform the wall splat. The key takeaways for this move are to keep your arms spread wider in order to alleviate any potential shoulder discomfort, driving your knee towards to the wall, and sinking your hips into the movement as you try to bring yourself closer to the wall. Doing the last two will help you to feel to move your thoracic spine deeper through the range of motion as you come closer to the wall. You will feel this almost instantly and will be good feedback on what your upper back should feel like when it has full range of motion.\n\nThe third move that you should perform in order to get rid of upper back pain is a mobilization drill that I like to call “can openers”. Simply get down on your knees and elbows, place one arm behind your head and rotate your upper back so that that arm is now pointing towards the ceiling. Hold at the top for a few seconds before returning to rest and then repeating the move again. Something to note in this move is the actively retract the shoulder blade of the arm that is bent behind the head. Repeat on the other side to make sure you avoid any imbalances.\n\nThis stretch, the 11:15 stretch (as I like to call it,) not only works great, but feels great too. One of the biggest points to make note of on this move is to not only make sure that your arms are in the right position, but to retract the shoulder blade of the arm that is in the 15 position. Just like with the can openers, while you want to reach out as far as you can in this position, you also want to actively retract that scapula. This willl help to reinforce the mobilization of the thoracic spine which is key in order to fix that upper back pain you’ve been going through.\n\nThe last move that you can perform here in this sequence is one that I’ve suggest that you should do every day in order to feel amazing. This is called the bridge and reach over. Not only does this movement help to mobilize the thoracic spine with the reach over, but it also allows for the entire kinetic chain to get involved so that you are moving multiple parts of your body in concert. From your feet all the way up to your head, you are working everything in tandem and making sure that everything mobilized. I think this is one of the best things you can do for any back pain, especially in the upper back.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete workout program that will fix your aches and pains while also helping you to build a ripped athletic body, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below and check out the program selector to find the right program for you.\n\nFor more videos on how to fix back pain as well as any other joints that might be bothering you, be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel using the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "The WORST Fitness YouTuber Ever (HARSH!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/360-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you follow fitness online, specifically on YouTube, you might want to know who the worst fitness YouTuber is. After all, you want to know if you should be avoiding somebody’s advice, right? In this video, I am going to explain to you the problem with the use of the term “suboptimal” and what I think needs to replace it in order to benefit the fitness community.\n\nIt seems everywhere you look when it comes to online fitness, you have somebody throwing out the term “suboptimal”. Whether it’s a video reviewing somebody else or even just a comment left on a post; we have countless instances where someone claims that something is suboptimal. To me, this sounds like the new version of “CNS burnout,” a common buzzphrase that was seemingly used by everyone as an excuse for something not going well in their training.\n\nNot only do I think that this is the new buzzword when it comes to fitness, I also like to consider it the new “mommy pay attention to me” format for fitness social media. I find that people posting fitness content online are so devoid of content, that they have to resort to criticizing others and trying to call something they are doing suboptimal in order to gain the attention of the audience.\n\nAs a fitness professional, I have never made a habit of criticizing other trainers or even influencers. I understand and appreciate, instead, the thing that should be the next buzzword in fitness: context. I find that context is one of the most important things to understand when it comes to reviewing somebody else’s training or training program.\n\nToo quickly, someone will rush to call something suboptimal based on their own lack of knowledge. Knowledge around the context of what someone is doing is extremely important because it can help you to understand exactly why somebody might be doing something. I have a problem when someone ignores context and makes a statement based on their blanket expectations. It’s important to understand that not everyone shares the same goals, limitations / accessibilities, or needs. \n\nSomebody who is new to fitness, has limited access to equipment, and history of injuries is going to be training very differently than the 4x Mr. Olympia, Chris Bumstead. This is an example of context. Another example would be a barbell row vs. a chest supported row. Before saying that the chest supported row is suboptimal training, you might be pressed to know that the person performing it might have a low back problem that doesn’t let them bent-over row.\n\nWhat about combination exercises? Those can’t be optimal when the limitations of one hinders another. Well, what if you were doing that combination for a specific purpose like creating a conditioning effect? Or what about a dumbbell front raise vs. a pate trap raise? Someone might call one of these exercises suboptimal and they look similar, but they serve different purposes. One is for the shoulders and one is for the lower traps, so how can one be better than the other?\n\nI can even even relate this back to my time with the New York Mets. When a player would go down with an injury, the training staff would get numerous letters with speculation of how and why that player got hurt. In every instance, they had no idea the actual context around the injury and were often writing in based on a report that came out in the newspaper. A report that often didn’t include the actual nature of the injury, such as an adductor strain being called a hamstring strain.\n\nAnother instance of this occurring is when Lebron James released a video of himself squatting. People online were so quick to judge and comment on his depth, or lack thereof, and call what he was doing suboptimal. These people had no context as to why he was squatting like that. How did they know that Lebron’s trainer didn’t program for a specific reason? There’s research pointing to the effectiveness of quarter squats when it comes to basketball players and their on-court abilities such as jumping and explosiveness.\n\nSo, before you go around calling somebody’s training “sub-optimal”, you need to understand the context regarding what they are doing. Just because it’s not something you do or it doesn’t fit your specific goals, does not mean that isn’t optimal for somebody else.\n\nFor a step-by-step workout program that takes all of this into account and takes out all the guesswork for you, head on over to the ATHLEAN-X website via the link below and use the program selector to find the one that best matches your goals.\n\nFor more videos on effective exercises and workouts, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube using the link below and don’t forget to turn on your notifications so you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "12 Supersets EVERYONE Should Have in Their Workout!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/359-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nSupersets can be amazing for increasing muscle size if you choose the right ones. In this video, I’m going to show you the 12 greatest supersets that everyone should have in their programs if they want to get their best results from their workouts. \n\nIt helps to define exactly what a superset is (and what it is not). By definition, it is a pair of exercises done back to back with minimal to no rest in between. The time it takes to transition between one exercise and the next is all that is allowed. This brings to the forefront an important idea when it comes to putting these combinations together. That is, they must be exercises that allow you to transition quickly and not take up too much time or equipment in the gym to do them.\n\nAll it takes is a busy gym to interrupt your ability to do a superset that requires you to occupy a bench and a pullup bar for example. Leave the bench to run over to the pullup bar and you very well could lose your spot and have throw that superset out in regards to its effectiveness.\n\nAll of the ones here were carefully put together with these limitations in mind. \n\nNow, there is no definitive rule that states that all supersets must pair up opposing muscle groups. This is a common misconception. You can place agonist or antagonist muscles back to back in any superset and get very different but equally effective results. As you’ll see, you can also pair up exercises that serve to either enhance the performance of the second in the pair (via a pre-exhaust) or via a restorative effect that accelerates recovery of the first exercise.\n\nWith that said, here is a quick summary of the 12 supersets that everyone should have in their program if they want to see their best overall results. Be sure to watch the whole video for why each exercise was selected in each pairing.\n\n1. DB Static Bench Press into DB Gorilla Rows\n\n2. Wrap Around Rows into Cable Crossovers\n\n3. Cable Curls into Standing Overhead Cable Extensions\n\n4. Lying Incline Triceps Extensions into DB Spider Curls\n\n5. DB Reverse Lunges into DB RDL’s\n\n6. DB Overhead Press into DB Hip Huggers\n\n7. DB “L” Raises into DB Overhead Press\n\n8. Seated Knee Tucks into Reverse Hyperextensions\n\n9. Barbell Squats into Dead Arm Hangs\n\n10. DB Incline Bench Press into Chest Supported Rows\n\n11. Straight Arm Pushdowns into Face Pulls\n\n12. DB Spanish Squats into Banded Kneeling Hip Thrusts\n\nEach of these supersets accomplishes the main goals of being both time and space efficient. If you want to perform these right for maximum muscle growth and effectiveness, you have to be able to choose the exercises that are best. I’ve done the work for you, now you just have to go out and do them.\n\nSupersets are easily able to be incorporated into any training program, if you happen to not be doing any of them at the moment. Even if you’re following a push pull legs split (PPL) where you are training all pushing or pulling muscles in the same workout. You just wouldn’t opt for the antagonist supersets like chest and back exercises. You would instead aim for something like the shoulder examples shown here, where back to back shoulder exercises are used to help you to increase the intensity of each.\n\nIf you are already including supersets in your workout program then you may want to revisit how they look in comparison to the ones shown here. Again, even the shortest delay in moving from the first to the second exercise in the pair can compromise the effect of what you are trying to accomplish in the first place. These have built-in efficacy because of the selections and are something you will definitely want to try the next time you train.\n\nIf you’re looking for a complete program that often times includes these types of effective supersets into the workouts, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below. Remember to use the program selector to allow me to help you find the program that best matches your current goals.\n\nFor more workout videos and the best exercises or supersets to build muscle be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below.

        "title": "How to Fall Asleep in 60 Seconds (OR LESS!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/358-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wished you could fall asleep in 60 seconds or less? If so, then this is the video for you. I am going to breakdown not only a technique that I have used for much of my life that helps me to fall asleep fast, but also one of the leading causes for disrupted sleep as well and something that you can do to help mitigate the problems caused by this one thing.\n\nWhen it comes to fitness, we know that the obvious keys to success in changing our bodies for the better are found in our nutrition and our efforts in the weight room. However, there is a very important factor that leads to the most muscle growth possible and that is recovery. One of the most imperative and driving factors that comes along with recovery is sleep.\n\nThe time that we spend sleeping allows for the body to recover and repair to form new muscle. Not only that, but a lack of sleep can be detrimental to your very next workout leading to the impairment of your goals. Think about this, if you are exhausted from a lack of sleep, do you think that you are going to be able to perform at your highest abilities? Probably not!\n\nInsomnia is not something rare either. Around 270 million people worldwide are affected by the inability to sleep with “can’t sleep” being one of the highest googled search terms.\n\nSo what do you do if you are one of those people that can’t sleep and have tried a number of different techniques to finally get yourself to knock out? Well, I have something for you that has helped me and countless others to fall asleep in 60 seconds or less.\n\nIt all comes down to relaxing the body. This might sound simple but many people have a lot of trouble achieving this. In fact, as a physical therapist, I know that one of the most efficient ways to get someone to relax a muscle is to put it through a contraction first. This will allow for an individual to gauge the difference between tensing a muscle up and actually being able to relax it.\n\nFirst, start at the eyebrows - raise them as high as you can and hold it for 5 seconds. Breathe out for 5 seconds and allow them to relax down in the process. Then close your eyes as hard as you can for 5 seconds before breathing out for 5 seconds and allowing them to relax as well. After that, you will smile as wide as you can, following the same practice. Shrug your shoulders up before relaxing and do this for the muscles that lead down the rest of your body. You should be asleep before you even get to your toes.\n\nNot only does this technique relax the muscles in the body, but it can help relax the mind as well. One of the chief complaints about insomnia is racing thoughts. Focusing on the breathing, the relaxation of the muscles, and keeping the mind off of other topics will help to keep the mind at ease leading to you falling asleep faster.\n\nWhat about the external factor that is causing people to have trouble to fall asleep or stay asleep? Well this is caused by the exposure to blue light from our cell phones. We know from Dr. Andrew Huberman as well as many other sources that there is a direct correlation between light expose and brain physiology. Research shows that blue light mitigates the secretion of melatonin in the body and the blue light emitted from our cell phones before bed is a major disruptor of sleep.\n\nSo what can you do? Outside the obvious of not looking at your phone 30-60 minutes prior to bedtime, there is a built-in functionality of the iPhone that will actually eliminate blue light exposure. In your settings, under the accessibility feature, there is an ability to apply a color filter - specifically a red filter. Red light has been shown to be easier on the eyes and the changing away from blue light means that you are not going to exposing your brain to melatonin reduction.

        "title": "The 💯 Leg Workout (MOST EFFECTIVE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/357-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want a leg workout that is going to be most effective at helping you to build bigger legs, this is the one. Continuing on in the 100 workout series, we are hitting the quads, glutes, hamstrings and calves in one efficient routine that is going to help you to build muscle in your legs.\n\nThe workout’s efficacy revolves around the concept of effective reps. Whenever you perform a set of, say 12 reps to failure, the first 7 or 8 are not really challenging at all. In fact, some argue that they serve no purpose other than to fatigue your muscle to get to the point where the reps do start to become difficult. Well, what if there was a way to tap into these more effective, growth inducing reps more quickly? There is, and that is where this 100 leg workout steps in.\n\nWe kick off the workout for legs with one of my favorite leg exercises of all time, the dumbbell bulgarian split squat. Grabbing a pair of dumbbells that will cause failure in our first set at 8 on each leg, we perform what we call our ignition set. Keep in mind, these reps are not going to count towards your 100 rep total for this workout. They are just serving to kick off this exercise and pre-fatigue the reps that are to come after on this leg exercise. \n\nAfter reaching failure on the ignition set you will rest/pause for just 15 seconds before jumping back into your first set of effective reps. Now keep in mind, leg workouts can be grueling for many. If that is the case for you, feel free to extend your rest slightly but do so realizing that the spirit of the workout as written is for you to ultimately be able to do this with your rest limited to just 15 seconds each time.\n\nPerform 15 effective reps on each leg, making sure to get all of them done on one leg before proceeding to the other.\n\nThe next exercise up is one for the posterior chain which will give a much needed reprieve to the quads and anterior chain muscles - and it’s the barbell RDL. The key to doing this glute and hamstring exercise right is to hinge at the waist and soften at the knees. Don’t lean the barbell out too far in front of you as this puts unnecessary strain on your low back. \n\nAim for 20 effective reps after your ignition set of 12 to failure to kick it off.\n\nThe next exercise is going to take you back to the anterior chain with the dumbbell alternating reverse lunges. Two great tips that make this exercise easier to perform are to remember to keep your back foot traveling not just back, but out as well. This will broaden your base of support and help you to maintain balance from the split stance position. This is especially helpful when you are handling heavy weights as you will on this leg exercise that is to be performed at an 8RM ignition set leading into 15 effective reps each leg.\n\nOnce again, we keep this leg workout moving by heading back to the posterior chain exercises, this time with a cable pull through. If you struggled to perform the hinge the first time around, you will not now. This is because the cable and rope help to pull your body into the proper position on every rep. Just remember to squeeze with the glutes to bring you back to the top into full hip extension.\n\nThe DB Spanish Squat is an amazing way to train resisted closed chain knee extension without having to use the open chain alternative leg extensions. The addition of the dumbbells to this leg exercise make it even more brutal and capable of trashing your legs in just the 15 effective reps I’m asking for.\n\nFinally, you can’t complete your workout for legs without a little bit of calf work. Most people focus too much on the gastrocnemius and not enough on the soleus. Let’s change that by performing 15 effective reps on the seated DB calf raise. Remember to squeeze your contraction at the top and also slow down and hold the bottom position of stretch to remove some of the ballistic tendency of the achilles to dominate the calf muscles.\n\nFor a quick summary of this 100 leg workout, it looks like this:\n\nDB Bulgarian Split Squats x 15 effective reps each leg (do one leg at a time to completion)\nBarbell RDL’s x 20 effective reps\nDB Alt. Reverse Lunges x 15 effective reps each leg\nCable Pullthroughs x 20 effective reps\nDB Spanish Squats x 15 effective reps\nDB Seated Calf Raises x 15 effective reps\n\nIf you’re looking for more workouts in this series, remember to subscribe to our youtube channel via the link below and turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published. \n\nIf you’d like to start training like an athlete today so you can build ripped muscle that can perform whenever needed, be sure to visit athleanx.com via the link below and I’ll help you find the program that best matches your goals.",

        "title": "Masturbation is KILLING Your Strength! (NEW RESEARCH)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/356-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wondered whether masturbating before your workouts is helping or hurting your ability to build muscle? If so, then you’re definitely going to want to watch this video. Here, we are going to discuss how the timing of masturbating before your workout could potentially help or harm your efforts in the gym.\n\nThe last time that we discussed the topic of masturbation and working out, we covered the release of testosterone and its affect on muscle growth. We came to the conclusion that testosterone levels were negligibly affected by masturbation and that the act had little if not nothing to do with any increase or decrease in the ability to build muscle. \n\nHowever, it was worth noting some of the other effects that masturbation has on an individual. It has been shown that masturbation to orgasm has a benefit to create a calming and relaxing sensation. Knowing this particular effect, it could be beneficial to partake prior to bedtime as it can lead to more relaxed and restful sleep. We know that sleep is one of the most important aspects of muscle growth and recovery, so it would make sense that if one were to participate in the act, that they should do so before going to sleep.\n\nSo, you might be thinking to yourself that case is closed right there; if you are going to masturbate, do it before you go to bed so that you can get better, more restful sleep to aid in your muscle recovery. Well, not so fast.\n\nLooking at relatively new research, science is pointing to the fact there is a release of cannabinoids post masturbating to orgasm. Specifically the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, otherwise known as 2-AG. This ligand binds to the CB-2 receptor which then causes an elevation in overall mood as well as increase in pain threshold.\n\nWhat does an improvement in mood and an elevated pain threshold have to do with working out and building muscle? Quite a bit actually! You might think that by boosting your mood and increasing your pain tolerance would be the ultimate pre-workout. However, it might depend on the type of training that you are going to be engaging in.\n\nWhen it comes to building muscle, we know that there are three main drivers of hypertrophy - strength/tension overload, eccentric overload, and metabolic overload. Of those three drivers, eccentric and metabolic overload are the ones that incur the most discomfort when being performed. These two methods will be the ones where you feel the “burn” in your muscles as you reach failure and continue past that point. \n\nSo, if you are going to be training using one of these two methods, then a boost in calmness and relaxation as well as a higher pain threshold could likely lead you to squeeze out more reps in your workout that you might not have been able to achieve otherwise. In this case, I would say the masturbating prior to your workout might be something beneficial when it comes to building muscle.\n\nOn the other hand, what about if you were training for strength? How would masturbation affect your ability to move more weight? Well, this is where I would say that masturbation could be something that you want to avoid. Why? When you are working in the pursuit of strength and you are moving heavier loads, then your body wants to be excited, primed, and ready to exert maximal effort. This is why you will see strength athletes using smelling salts and loud music to get themselves psyched up to perform their next lift.\n\nSo, should you masturbate prior to working out? Well, that depends on what your going to be doing in that specific workout. Lots of metabolic and eccentric focused efforts would lead me to say that it might be helpful in getting you through the toughest sets. But if you are looking to be moving maximum weight, I would advise against it as a “relaxation” could mean that you’re not primed for the lift.\n\nThis really is a situation where it is up to the individual.\n\nFor a complete workout program that prioritizes recovery as a way of building muscle faster, be sure to check out athleanx.com and use the program selector linked below to find the program best suited to your specific body goals. \n\nFor more videos on how to build muscle and the best way to recover between workouts, be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "You NEED Supplements to Build Muscle! (FACT)",
        "description": "Top rated supplements to build muscle - http://athleanx.com/athleanrx\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIt’s a common to wonder whether you need supplements to build muscle, however in this video I’m going to show you exactly who should take them and when they are necessary to grow. Any supplement discussion however has to start with the type of supplements we are talking about. By far, the two most popular categories are pre workouts and protein powders. All other vitamins, pills and powders settle in at a distant third to these two best sellers. \n\nThat said, rather than pushing everyone to take supplements like the trainer that is highlighted in this video, I think there are some important considerations that must be made first. Right off the bat, the status of the person inquiring must be considered. If you are a rank beginner with no training experience, I would highly recommend that you do not take supplements. Too often they become a crutch for the newbie and an excuse to not get the most important element of their fitness in place - and that is their nutrition.\n\nSupplements are called supplements for a reason. They are meant to supplement a solid nutrition plan not take the place of one. Quality whole foods need to comprise the majority of your daily meal plan if you want to see long term success and improvements in your body that will last. The commitment to a healthier lifestyle does and always will reside inside of you and not inside of a bottle.\n\nNow, some want to know whether this recommendation to avoid supplements as a rank beginner extends to protein powders. Quite honestly, I do not look at protein as a supplement. It’s more of a meal replacement or, better said, a meal amplifier. We know it can be difficult to consume the amount of protein required to support lean muscle, especially if the person is on the beginner side of their fitness journey. Likely their diet up to now has been filled with plenty of processed carbohydrates and making the adjustment to more proteins can be challenging. \n\nIn these cases, the intake of some additional protein to coincide with their adoption of eating more lean meats, beans, lentils, etc is going to make it easier for them to meet their daily requirements. This would be\na good time to invest in them. Again however, protein is something that is readily available in adequate amounts if the person so desires, through whole food means and is therefore not something considered to be a pure supplement in my opinion. To me, the ingredients that are simply not able to be gotten in adequate amounts to create their desired effect through food alone is going to fall into the category of supplements.\n\nNow, there is something known as the ‘play for the tie’ mentality. This again is something you do not want to do if you care about the results you get and don’t feel like wasting your money. Just because you eat healthy greens in the morning doesn’t mean that you can forego the need to make healthy food choices at the remainder of your whole food meals throughout the day. Not only does this not work in the long term but it often leaves the person confused because they feel as if their one healthy habit should pay bigger dividends than it does and they end up frustrated and more likely to give up all together.\n\nWhen your meal plan and diet are dialed in however, that is the point when supplements can become very effective. As mentioned above, there are certain ones that just cannot be consumed in adequate dosages to make a difference through food alone. Creatine and beta alanine are two perfect examples of this. You would have to eat over 2-3 pounds of beef or chicken respectively, every single day, in order to meet your required maintenance dose of 5 grams of creatine monohydrate (2 grams of creatine hcl) or 3200mg of beta alanine. \n\nThis is just impossible to do and, even if you were able to do it for a day or two, not something you could sustain for the long term.\n\nThe bottom line is, supplements can absolutely put you over the edge in terms of your fitness and physique if you have the basics in place first. In fact, in almost every instance, if you show me a person who eats right and trains consistently and takes the right supplements - they are always going to be in better shape than the same version of that person not taking supplements.\n\nIf you found the video helpful, make sure to leave a comment and check out other videos on this channel via the link below.

        "title": "The GREATEST Exercises of All Time (HIT EVERY MUSCLE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/354-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wondered what are the 20 greatest exercises of all time? In this video, I am going to put together a list of what I feel are the 20 greatest exercises of all time and why I feel so strongly about them so that way you know exactly which ones you should be including in your workout routine. Not only that, I am going to give you some tips for each exercise that will help to make sure you are getting the absolute most benefit out of them.\n\nIn this list of 20 great exercises, there are going to be some exercises that you would expect anyone to include in the top 20 as well as a few exercises that you might be surprised to be given such a high honor. You can expect that some of the bigger, compound lifts are surely going to make the list - but you might be shocked to find some smaller, more corrective exercises within the rankings as well.\n\nI believe that some corrective exercises hold more weight in their benefits than you might have considered before watching the video. Just because they are a smaller exercise that targets smaller, more neglected muscle groups does not make them any less important. In fact, I would argue that that is what makes them so much MORE important than people give them credit for.\n\nThat being said, let’s take a look at the list and see which exercises fall into the category of greatest of all time…\n\nFirst up, we have the barbell squat otherwise known as the king of all leg exercises. To make sure you are getting the most out of this leg exercise, it is important to keep a few things in mind. Make sure that you are moving the pelvis and the ribcage together as a single unit. This will prevent the dreaded squat morning and make sure that the exercise remains fluid. Secondly, try to “grip the ground” with your toes to help create a stable base through the foot. Doing so will make sure that you remove any instability from the bottom of the kinetic chain.\n\nNext up is the barbell curl. I like to add a little extra weight to this exercise and utilize the cheat variation because I can get a great overload on the biceps as well as taking advantage of my strength in the eccentric portion of the lift. One thing I like to do with the cheat curl is to keep a staggered stance - this is actually helpful for the cheat portion of the lift because it sets ourselves up to avoid excessive lean when bringing the bar up.\n\nThe dumbbell bench press is on this list of the greatest exercises of all time and for good reason. An awesome chest based exercise that is great for overloading the pecs and adds in a slight bit more adduction than it’s barbell-based cousin. Like the barbell bench press, it is important to take advantage of the use of your legs during the press by utilizing leg drive. Some people might argue that they avoid the dumbbell version based on shoulder problems they may have, but I often give the suggestion to play around with the speed or tempo of the reps as slowing them down may actually help solve a stability problem.\n\nNo list of greatest exercises could be complete without the inclusion of pullups. My suggestion on this exercise is to stop simply trying to increase the number of reps you can do on the exercise and instead add some weight to overload the movement. The weighted pull-up is a great strength developer and muscle building exercise when included into a routine. One tip that I would give with this exercise is to instead of pulling with your biceps and forearms, use the lats. My cue for this is to put your elbows in your back pockets on each rep.\n\nIf the squat is the king of all leg exercises, then the reverse lunge has to be considered the prince. By training through a staggered stance, we are making use of functional, real world movement patterns. Not only that but the exercise maintains an important versatility as well; not only does the lunge allow you to train with either a barbell or dumbbells to match your strength capabilities, you can also alter your torso position to better target different muscle groups. \n\nOf course, there are many more exercises on this list to help you build muscle and get stronger. Be sure to watch the whole video to get the entire list and a breakdown on each exercise.\n\nIf you’re looking for a complete workout plan that includes the exercises featured on this list of the greatest of all time, be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below and use the program selector to find the program that best matches your current goals.\n\nIf you’re looking for more videos on the best exercises for building muscle, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "Stop Making These Exercise Mistakes! (I’M BEGGING YOU)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/352-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nWhether you are a stepping into a gym for the first time or you’re a seasoned vet, you are going to want to avoid the most common gym exercise mistakes. In this video, I am going to show you 17 of the most common gym exercise mistakes and what you can do to avoid them. If gains are what you’re after, you’ll want to be getting them right.\n\nThe first common gym exercise mistake that you might be making is on the leg extension machine. You might be running to this exercise to hammer your legs - whether it’s because you think it directly isolates the quads or because it’s just an easy to perform exercise; I suggest you utilize your time on a safer, more effective exercises to blow up your quads.\n\nOn the flip side of the legs, you might be performing leg curls to target your hamstrings. The big mistake here is driving your knees into the pad causing an over activation of the hip flexors. If this happens, then you are asking for lower back pain. Instead, activate your glutes before each rep. A better option is to perform the exercise standing or seated if you have the opportunity.\n\nProbably the most popular gym exercise for building muscle is the DB bench press. One of the biggest mistakes that you can make when performing this exercise is to forget about leg drive. By not utilizing your lower body through each rep, you are missing out on an opportunity to move heavier weight which we know can be used to build more strength and size.\n\nSticking with the chest, the pec deck is another popular exercise that beginners and veterans will find themselves performing to build a big chest. A big mistake that I often see when people perform this exercise is the idea that you are supposed to “hug the tree”. By performing this motion, you are incurring more work to be done by the shoulders instead of the chest which is the muscle group you are trying to target in the first place. Instead, think of driving your back into the pad and squeezing with your chest.\n\nThe next common mistake I see is when it comes to the skull crushers. Instead of using your head as the target point of the rep, I would suggest getting the bar back overhead in order to increase the stretch on the long head of the triceps. Doing so will give greater muscle activation, leading to more muscle growth which is what you are seeking in the first place.\n\nIf you have been watching me for any length of time, you know what mistake I am going to call out on the lateral raises; pouring the pitcher at the top of each rep. By letting the pinkies raise higher than the thumbs as the arms go up, you are introducing internal rotation with elevation which is a recipe for shoulder pain and impingement. \n\nThe leg press is one of those gym exercises that I see misperformed all too often. One of the biggest mistakes I see is the foot placement; always far too high on the plate. This can cause a positioning of the body that forces the low back off the back pad of the machine which is not something that we want. Instead, bring your feet lower on the plate.\n\nThe seated DB press is one of the most commonly perform shoulder exercises that I happen to think is riddled with mistakes. While seated, it often happens that as you fatigue through the set, in order to press the dumbbells up overhead, you are drive your back into the seat. The major problem with this is the fact that it disrupts normal scapular movement through the range of motion. Instead, you would want to keep your back off the back of the seat in order to keep the scapular rhythm in check.\n\nWhen it comes to building triceps, you will almost always see triceps pushdowns in somebody’s workout or program. Why? It’s a great exercise! The only problem is the way that people sometimes perform it. By not letting the wrists go into extension as you press the bar down, you are sacrificing an opportunity to for full elbow extension to make sure the triceps are doing the most work possible. So make sure that you are letting your wrists extend with each rep.\n\nBe sure to watch the entire video to see the rest of the most common gym exercise mistakes and just how to avoid them to make sure that you are getting the best and safest gains possible.\n\nIf you are looking for a workout program that makes sure you avoid any and all gym mistakes while helping you to build muscle, head over to the ATHLEAN-X website and use the program selector to find the workout program that fits your goals today.\n\nFor more videos on what exercises to do in the gym and how to do them properly, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube using the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "Get “Six Pack Abs” in 22 Days! (2023 AB WORKOUT)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/351-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want to get six pack abs without any equipment and you’re not sure what ab workout to do, then this is the one for you. This six pack workout is designed to do two things in only 22 days. The first is to train your abs they way they should be in order to get stronger abs. Your upper abs, lower abs, and obliques will be trained through their functions to most effectively hit them. \n\nThe next most important part of this six pack workout is that research has shown that it takes 22 days to form a behavior. We also know that when one behavior is changed or formed, others tend to follow suit. If you stick to this 6 pack ab workout for just 22 days, you will start to see changes to your lifestyle as well as your approach to working out and your nutrition for the rest of your life.\n\nIt is this element that makes this plan effective for even someone that is at a much higher body fat percentage, something that they will want to invest their time in doing. While the six pack abs may not be completely visible by the time the 22nd day rolls around, it is the habits and behaviors formed that can carry over and be the biggest game changer of all.\n\nIt’s important to note, however, that while you are making a commitment to this workout you are not underscoring the role that nutrition plays when it comes to having visible abs. I’ve said it many times before that the most important element of getting ripped and staying lean is having a good nutrition plan. I also mentioned previously that behaviors tend to pair together - meaning that as your behaviors change for the better with your commitment to this workout, your commitment to your nutrition will also likely change for the better along with it.\n\nThe good news is that your body fat levels do not have be nearly as low as you may have previously thought they needed to be in order to get a six pack. Some can even see the outline of a complete set of abs at body fat levels in the mid teens!\n\nThat said, here is how this extinction style ab workout breaks down.\n\nThere are 6 total ab exercises in this routine. They start with lower ab movements and progress through midrange and oblique exercises, ending with top down movements at the end to preferentially target the upper ab fibers. The key to getting six pack abs is that you perform them for the given rep or time range. If you can do this successfully, simply rest for 10 seconds and repeat the exercise. Keep repeating the rep or time range until you cannot perform all the prescribed reps or time. Once this happens, you have reached extinction. Once you reach extinction, you move onto the next exercise in the six pack workout and complete it in the same manner.\n\nThis 6 pack workout contains the following ab exercises:\n\nLower Ab Spikes x 10 reps\nSeated Knee Tuck Drags x 45 seconds\nPower Ups x 10 reps\nSeated High Twists x 45 seconds\nBackwards 7’s x 5 reps each side\nSunrise Situps x 45 seconds\n\nThis entire ab circuit is to be performed just one time through, however, remember that you may be repeating individual exercises more than once if you are able to complete all the prescribed reps or time. In that case, you would rest 10 seconds and repeat the exercise until you couldn’t complete what was prescribed in terms or reps or time.\n\nThis ab workout is a killer one but can be done by anyone, regardless off ability level or body fat level. If you are looking for a bodyweight workout program that doesn’t require any equipment at all to get a ripped athletic body, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the ATHLEAN XERO program. You won’t need bands, benches, bars, or weights in order to get the body you are looking for.\n\nFor more ab workouts to get 6 pack abs, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube using the link below and check out some of our follow along ab workouts.

        "title": "17 Foods I Eat EVERY Single Day!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/350-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIn case you didn’t know, there are 17 food I eat every single day for 6 pack abs and to make sure that I stay lean all year round. In this video, I am going to cover the foods that are included in my diet every single day that help me to stay lean and have six pack abs, as well as some of the reasons why I choose to include them, other than the fact that they taste good.\n\nThe first food on my list comes with breakfast and it is egg whites. Some of the major benefits of including egg whites in my muscle building diet is that the 6 egg whites I have each morning contains 24 grams of protein. The egg whites are a great lower calorie breakfast option that contain less fat than other common breakfast proteins such as sausage or bacon.\n\nSticking with breakfast, one of the staples of my diet and food that I eat every single day is oatmeal. Not only is it rich in complex carbohydrates to keep me fueled throughout the day, but it is high in fiber to help regulate cholesterol as well it contains magnesium to help alleviate muscle cramps due to my workouts. Add in the fact that there oatmeal contains 0 grams of sugar, and we are off to a good start.\n\nI include skim milk in my daily diet plan as well. Not only do I drink a glass of it with breakfast, but I use it with my oatmeal and protein shake that I have alter in the day. I find that the low fat option is a better choice on a calorie-controlled diet than whole milk, simply because of how much I consume in a day. I also opt for a fortified version with the addition of vitamins A and D.\n\nA food that I eat every single day is actually cinnamon. Not only is it loaded with antioxidants, but it has anti-inflammatory properties and has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. This is extremely beneficial to someone focused on building muscle and staying lean in the process.\n\nGreek yogurt is another staple of my diet, having it at lunch every single day. Not only is it high in protein, calcium and vitamins - greek yogurt is know to improve gut health thanks to the presence of probiotics. While rich in protein, some will boast that greek yogurt contains all essential amino acids, but the way I make those proteins complete is by adding some chia or pumpkin seeds to it. This helps to boost the muscle building properties of the food itself.\n\nI have gone on record stating that I have a perpetual sweet tooth, but there is a way that I keep it in check; I eat frozen yogurt every day. In order to keep on a diet to build muscle and stay lean, avoiding high calorie, high fat sugary sweets, I indulge in a low calorie dessert that I think tastes delicious. I think it is important to be able to find options that can curb your sweet tooth, as long as it isn't compromising your goals.\n\nSomething you will find on my plate every single day is a lean protein. When it comes to building muscle and having a six pack, protein is going to be one of the most important parts of your diet and it is certainly something that I will never overlook. I opt for chicken, fish, and lean red meat to satiate my protein needs with each meal have 30-50 grams of protein per serving. Not only that, but they can be prepared in so many ways to make sure you enjoy your meal every single time.\n\nOne food that I eat every single day and that I likely couldn't live without is pasta. I am a big believer that carbohydrates are staple for any muscle building nutrition plan that has any sort of longevity to it. I truly think that deprivation based diets are destined to fail where a healthy eating plan has you indulge responsibly. Pasta not only tastes good, but is a great glycogen replenisher to support hard training. So, if I can recommend that you eat pasta, I would say go for it, just don't overdo it because it can definitely lead to weight gain if you don't pay attention to how much you are eating.\n\nCruciferous vegetables are an important inclusion in my daily eating plan with quite a few benefits. Not only do they contain sulforaphane which cancels out free radicals to help prevent early aging, but they are also shown to decrease myostatin activity to unlock new muscle growth. Add in their powerful anti-inflammatory properties and you will see just why I make sure to include these vegetables in my daily diet plan.\n\nBe sure to watch the rest of the video to see the other foods I eat every single day and why I include them in my diet plan to build muscle and stay lean. \n\nIf you are looking for a day-by-day meal plan to go along with your workouts, they are included with every workout program I designed that can be found at the ATHLEAN-X website via the link below.\n\nFor more videos on nutrition and building muscle, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube using the link below and make sure to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a new video when it's published.",

        "title": "You Can't Build Muscle OVER 40 Naturally!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/349-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIt is commonly felt that you can’t build muscle over 40 naturally or without the use of PED’s. In this video, I’m tackling this conception head on. This comes in the form of a question and answer session where we open up our comment section to our viewers to ask their most burning questions. One of the themes that repeatedly comes up is on the subject of how much muscle can be built over the age of 40 naturally.\n\nIf you listen to most social media influencers, or simply look at their physiques, you may have noticed a trend in the last couple years towards unnatural development. With the great media push of the benefits of testosterone in “replacement” dosages, we have seen a record number of men move towards exogenous forms of T to help them build muscle.\n\nIn fact, some will have you convinced that it is the only way to build muscle, or even look good, over the age of 40.\n\nI couldn’t disagree more. \n\nThis has been used as a copout on a grand stage, for a reluctance to engage in hard work and consistent effort in training. In fact, the most rampant use of this strategy for building muscle is occurring in an age bracket far below the men in their 40’s. We are talking about kids in their 20’s who are abusing TRT and engaging in PED use in an attempt to speed up the natural process of bodybuilding. \n\nAs someone who has pursued my career as a lifelong natural, I find this to be discouraging and a disturbing trend in the wrong direction. Far too many social media influencers are knowingly or unknowingly leading many men, young and old, down the wrong path to fitness and better health.\n\nNot to mention, the times that the admission of TRT is actually a mere smokescreen for the things they won’t tell you they are taking are countless. Ever see a guy who wants you to think that the only thing he’s using is some replacement dose of hormones, when he has not only a history of long term PED use but a tendency to be caught up in supplement scams and legal troubles? I’m sure you have, because there are quite a few of them.\n\nThe point is, when PED’s are the first place our young lifters turn when they want to make muscle gains, we have a major issue and it’s one that has been caused unfortunately by the very platforms that have delivered the education to a hard working alternative. \n\n“You can’t build muscle over 40 naturally” is what they’ll say. \n\nThat is simply not true. There have actually been numerous, well conducted studies that have been done that prove otherwise.The key is a dedicated consistency to the cause.\n\nNo, I’m not talking about working out and eating right for a few weeks or even months. I’m talking about making sure to have all aspects of your training and nutrition in check and to continue on that path for years and years on end. It’s actually much easier to do when you are following a workout plan that doesn’t break your body down, but makes you feel better or when you are following a nutrition plan that doesn’t rely on starvation and deprivation but on eating in a way that is enjoyable and still progressive in terms of fat loss and muscle building.\n\nIf you look even at the case of a younger guy like Jesse from ATHLEAN-X, you can see what realistic muscle gains can look like. Some have witnessed his body transformation and called the 5 year results amazing. Others have viewed the very same videos and said that he is scrawny and hasn’t made any gains at all. It just goes to show you how distorted the perception of natural progress has become because of the blurred lines that have been created by social media and phony fitness influencers.\n\nThe key to making new gains starts in your head. \n\nYou need to realize that the degree of muscle growth and fat loss you desire is likely achievable through nothing more than hard work and dedication. It truly is. There are people who walk around right now with the type of body that you may desire, doing nothing more than staying true to their goals and leading the healthiest life possible in the pursuit of them. \n\nDoes it take more time?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThey don’t call them performance enhancing drugs for no reason. They will not only speed up the pace of the muscle building results that you can experience but they increase the degree and the amount of them that are possible. But that doesn’t mean that you need to choose that path.\n\nIf you’re looking for a complete workout and meal plan to build muscle and burn fat, be sure to check out athleanx.com via the link below and start training like an athlete today.\n\nFor more videos on how you can’t build muscle over 35 without TRT as well as workouts for men over 40, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "16 Muscle Building Mistakes I REGRET Making!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/348-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nI have made quite a few muscle building mistakes over the years that I regret, and today I'm sharing them with you. I'm going to discuss my 16 greatest regrets I made both in the gym and in the kitchen, when it came to my pursuit of building muscle and getting ripped.\n\nI started my journey of no longer wanting to be a skinny kid when I was about 13 years old. I trained alongside my older brother and tried to copy the exercises and workouts that he was doing. Along the way, I missed some important lessons and wound up paying the price.\n\nToday, I'm going to share with you some of those that I really wish I could go back and change. If I could have had this video available to me as a young teenager and into my twenties, I feel like I'd have a much different physique these days and one that was less rife with physical issues that came from poor training and education.\n\nAs a physical therapist, it starts with being able to take my knowledge now and forgive myself for simply not knowing what I do today. For instance, when I first started working out, I would open up the muscle building magazines and try to follow the 30-40 set routines and workouts of bodybuilders like Shawn Ray.\n\nAlong the way, I would experience pain and joint discomfort from performing the exercises incorrectly and doing them with incredible amounts of what would be junk volume. Not being enhanced like the models were, led me to experience much different results than what I expected from looking at their pictures alone and not knowing the whole story.\n\nI also was quite naive when it came to nutrition and supplementation. I thought, for instance, that all oats were created equal. This couldn't be any further from the truth. My early days of eating Quaker Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal in the packets led to lots of consumption of sugar with little benefit. The regular slow cook oats had zero grams of sugar. Only with education was I able to identify that and make the change that would lead to lower levels of body fat and a more ripped physique.\n\nI also had many mistakes when it came to performing exercises I probably should not have. Years of damage were done in a short period of time by performing strength based exercises without properly addressing my flat feet. The poor biomechanics and form on the exercises led to a quick breakdown of my knees which still plague me to this day.\n\nI often overlooked the benefits of progressive overload in my training. This was particularly true of my bodyweight and calisthenic exercises. Instead of opting for more overload in the form of a harder variation of the common exercise, I would just try to build more muscle by adding on more and more reps. This was a mistake I'd come to learn later in life but has paid big dividends since fixing.\n\nNutrition has always been a struggle for me. I went from not caring enough to caring way too much and becoming almost obsessive about what I put in my mouth. In previous videos I discussed how I became fat phobic and avoided almost all dietary fats. Here I talk about the inflexibility I had when working in professional baseball and found myself on the road with very few options for healthy nutrition at my disposal - at least not cheaply.\n\nI also discuss my oversight when it came to the value of eccentrics, particularly on pulling exercises. It's not hard to remember to slow down the rep on the way down in a pushing exercise like the bench press. This is often an automatic built-in body protection mechanism that keeps you safe under heavy loads. In pulling exercises however, the weight tends to fall away from you. It's easy to forget about lowering it slowly and because of that, you forego one of the greatest stimuli for muscle growth and gains.\n\nSpeaking of lost gains, it's easy to do when you are training in pain. I made the mistake of trying to workout with pain rather than around it. There is a big distinction between the two. If you want to keep building muscle fast then you have to respect when things aren't right in your body and find a way to keep training without continuing to aggravate the inflammation in your joints or injury to your muscles. \n\nMy personal battle with a shoulder injury took longer than I would have liked because I originally tried to keep performing the very exercises that were leading to pain and discomfort when performing them.\n\nFor this and other muscle building mistakes I regret making, be sure to watch the entire video.

        "title": "The 💯 Glute Workout (MOST EFFECTIVE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/347-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThe hundred glute workout requires all out effort, but the results are nothing short of amazing if you follow the glute exercises and protocols shown here. As always a solid glute workout should consist of exercises for your glute max and glute medius.  That said, even that doesn’t make this workout for glutes complete.  In order to round out your butt with a well rounded workout you need to spend more time focusing on the reps that actually count to help you build bigger, stronger glutes. That is what we do in this workout.\n\nIf you look at most glute workouts that people perform, they usually consist of the same glute exercises. The issue isn’t necessarily what you’re doing but how you’re doing them. In order to increase the intensity of the workouts you are doing you have to focus on increasing the intensity of each set you perform. Consider that in a normal set of 12 reps that only the last 2-3 are actually hard enough to provide enough stimulus for muscle growth.\n\nWhat if you had a way that allowed you to more quickly tap into those harder, more growth producing reps more quickly? You do, by incorporating a rest pause technique into your training. Here, when the set is resumed you are instantly back to recruiting more type II fibers which are more easily able to respond to your hard work in the form of new size. The accumulation of these more difficult, effective reps is what can easily help you to increase the size of your glutes while decreasing the length of your workout.\n\nWhen it comes to training in the effective rep range, ask yourself a question. When you perform a set of any glute exercise, do you take it to failure or close to failure? Likely, the only reps you feel that are challenging are the final 1 to 3 reps. This is because, it is only at the point after the muscle has been stressed enough to tap into the harder to reach type IIb muscle fibers that the task at hand becomes challenging enough to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. \n\nWith the glutes workout technique shown here and in this series, you’re going to more quickly tap into these growth inducing type II fibers. The strategy is as follows:\n\nPerform a set of the glute exercises shown below to 12 rep failure. Choose a weight that will cause you to fail at or close to the 12 rep mark. This is called the ignition set. At this point, the real work begins. Rest for just 15 seconds as part of a somewhat prolonged rest/pause. As soon as these 15 seconds are up, get back into another set. You will instantly recognize that the reps will be challenging more quickly due to the decreased recovery time allowed. \n\nYou are still using the same load however, therefore your glutes are still being subjected to the same external load. However many reps you get after each of these rest/pause increments are all deemed to be effective reps. Each bout should be taken to failure. Accumulate 20 effective reps, even if you’re getting just 1 out at a time at some point, and your work on that exercise is complete. \n\nIf for some reason you are unable to complete any more reps on your way to 20, end your set and aim to complete all 20 the next time you perform this workout.\n\nHere is how to construct the 100 glute workout with that in mind.\n\n- 0:00 100 Glute Workout\n- 0:25 Effective Reps\n- 1:03 Exercise 1\n- 2:04 Exercise 2\n- 3:17 Exercise 3 \n- 4:11 Exercise 4\n- 5:29 Exercise 5\n- 6:27 Optional Exercise\n\nBarbell Hip Thrust - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause as a Dead Row\nBarbell RDL - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \nDB Sprinter Lunges - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \nCable Pullthroughs - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause\nBanded Hip Drops - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause each side\n\nOptional: Glute Bridge/Curl Static Ladder x 20 reps using a 5 second isometric hold in the bridge position of each rep (Rest/Pause)\n\nAll totaled, this will amount to 100 effective reps in this intense glute workout.\n\nIf you have to adjust your weights down as the fatigue mounts, do so accordingly. You are not necessarily using your 12 rep max on an exercise, you are using a weight that will cause you to fail at the 12 rep mark in that given workout. Fatigue accumulating in the later glute exercises of this workout may cause you to have to drop down a bit to make this happen throughout the workout.\n\nThis is just one example of how to apply science to your glute workouts.  If you want to put science back in every workout you do, head to athleanx.com and get started right away on building a ripped, muscular, athletic body.\n\nFor more glute workout videos for building bigger, stronger glutes, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at the link above and don’t forget to turn on notifications.",

        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/346-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThis 5 year natural transformation is truly amazing when you consider not just the strength and size improvements made by Jesse but also the hurdles and obstacles he has had to overcome to do this. Jesse shares for the first time publicly, his long struggles with clinical depression and anxiety. \n\nGetting out of bed and to work could be a challenge for Jesse on many days. The thought of getting to the gym to workout seemed like being asked to climb a mountain. That is, until he found refuge in the gym. The walls of they gym provided a freedom from tormenting thoughts that allowed him to not only grow his body, but his outlook on life as well.\n\nAs many who have watched this channel have witnessed however, the journey was quickly interrupted by a near fatal car accident. Jesse sustained head trauma that took him away from training all together and greatly limited his ability to exert high effort when he finally returned to the gym. During this time, the habitual improvements he made were gone and he once again found it very hard to be consistent with any workout, let alone one advised to him by Coach Cavaliere. The trauma also made the depressive thoughts he silently carried around with him, even more persistent and pervasive.\n\nJesse's chronic sadness made eating difficult. He often times found himself having to force feed himself in order to provide enough calories to attempt to build muscle. Maintaining an appetite was a struggle. Given how skinny he was to start this was something that made it almost impossible for him to gain muscle at a rate that perhaps others his age would experience. Without enough high quality nutrients, and calories in general, Jesse was finding it almost impossible to support any of the time he spent working out in the form of new muscle gains.\n\n\n\nLittle by little, under the guidance of a professional strength coach, Jesse started seeing significant strength and muscle gains. All the while that his compound lifts like the squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press and weighted pullups were improving, he was also working on building up his size through the appropriate accessory exercises. \n\nEssentially, Jesse was following a hybrid strength and powerlifting program like BEAXST that was taking him to all new levels of muscle development and size. His confidence was growing and his gains kept coming. \n\nThrough love, support and the outreach by many in the AX community Jesse has been able to find acceptance and peace. In this space he has been able to appreciate the journey of fitness and its value far beyond the building of muscle. It has helped him bridge the gap of silence that prevented him from expressing what he had been dealing with for so many years.\n\nNow he hopes his video and story will do the same for you if you find yourself in a similar position as he did.\n\nThe transformation of Jesse is one of my proudest moments as a strength and conditioning coach. Watching him transform not only his body, his strength and his size but his confidence and most of all his acceptance and love of himself has been one of the most rewarding things to watch. Jesse is like a son to me in many ways. As expected, you will run into the situations where your words or advice may not be followed or listened to. But ultimately, when push comes to shove and the rubber hits the road, the willingness to turn to others for guidance and knowledge winds up producing the most direct path to results.\n\nI would love it if you are reading this if you could leave Jesse some love in the comments below. \n\nIf you or someone else suffers from depression, please reach out. Allow someone to help you. It's no longer a stigma but rather becoming the norm in this day of heightened pressures and expectations through social media. \n\nFor more life changing natural transformation videos, be sure to check out the athleanx reviews channel here on youtube and remember to subscribe to this channel via the link below.

        "title": "The 💯 Back Workout (MOST EFFECTIVE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/345-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThe hundred back workout requires all out effort, but the results are nothing short of amazing if you follow the back exercises and protocols shown here. As always a solid back workout should consist of exercises for your lats and upper back.  That said, even that doesn’t make this workout for back complete.  In order to round out your back with a well rounded workout you need to spend more time focusing on the reps that actually count to help you build a bigger back. That is what we do in this workout.\n\nIf you look at most arm workouts people perform, they usually consist of the same back exercises. The issue isn’t necessarily what you’re doing but how you’re doing them. In order to increase the intensity of the workouts you are doing you have to focus on increasing the intensity of each set you perform. Consider that in a normal set of 12 reps that only the last 2-3 are actually hard enough to provide enough stimulus for muscle growth.\n\nWhat if you had a way that allowed you to more quickly tap into those harder, more growth producing reps more quickly? You do, by incorporating a rest pause technique into your training. Here, when the set is resumed you are instantly back to recruiting more type II fibers which are more easily able to respond to your hard work in the form of new size. The accumulation of these more difficult, effective reps is what can easily help you to increase the size of your arms while decreasing the length of your workout.\n\nWhen it comes to training in the effective rep range, ask yourself a question. When you perform a set of any back exercise, do you take it to failure or close to failure? Likely, the only reps you feel that are challenging are the final 1 to 3 reps. This is because, it is only at the point after the muscle has been stressed enough to tap into the harder to reach type IIb muscle fibers that the task at hand becomes challenging enough to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. \n\nWith the back workout technique shown here and in this series, you’re going to more quickly tap into these growth inducing type II fibers. The strategy is as follows:\n\nPerform a set of the back exercises shown below to 12 rep failure. Choose a weight that will cause you to fail at or close to the 12 rep mark. This is called the ignition set. At this point, the real work begins. Rest for just 15 seconds as part of a somewhat prolonged rest/pause. As soon as these 15 seconds are up, get back into another set. You will instantly recognize that the reps will be challenging more quickly due to the decreased recovery time allowed. \n\nYou are still using the same load however, therefore your back is still being subjected to the same external load. However many reps you get after each of these rest/pause increments are all deemed to be effective reps. Each bout should be taken to failure. Accumulate 20 effective reps, even if you’re getting just 1 out at a time at some point, and your work on that exercise is complete. \n\nIf for some reason you are unable to complete any more reps on your way to 20, end your set and aim to complete all 20 the next time you perform this workout.\n\nHere is how to construct the 100 back workout with that in mind.\n\n- Barbell Row - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause as a Dead Row\n- Lat Pulldowns - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n- Seated Cable Row - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n- DB High Pulls - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause\n- Underhand Grip ROM Pulldowns - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause\n\nOptional: Inverted Rows x 20 reps using a 5 second isometric hold at the top of each rep (Rest/Pause)\n\nAll totaled, this will amount to 100 effective reps in this intense back workout.\n\nIf you have to adjust your weights down as the fatigue mounts, do so accordingly. You are not necessarily using your 12 rep max on an exercise, you are using a weight that will cause you to fail at the 12 rep mark in that given workout. Fatigue accumulating in the later back exercises of this workout may cause you to have to drop down a bit to make this happen throughout the workout.\n\nThis is just one example of how to apply science to your back workouts.  If you want to put science back in every workout you do, head to athleanx.com and get started right away on building a ripped, muscular, athletic body.\n\nFor more back workout videos for the lats, traps and upper back, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at the link above and don’t forget to turn on notifications.",

        "title": "40 Sets Per Week Per Muscle is Best?!?",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/344-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you ever wondered what the perfect volume per week is for building muscle, then you are going to want to watch this new video. Find out how many sets and reps should be done per muscle group per week in order to see the most muscle gains. Muscle building science can be quite confusing when it comes to the topic of muscle growth and workout volume. Here we will try and decode the information to give you the best approach to succeed in your workouts.\n\nIt starts with understanding the interplay between volume and intensity. First of all, intensity by definition is simply a representation of the amount of weight that you are lifting. This is often represented in one of two ways. Either as a percentage of your one rep max or as RPE, or the perceived exertion and gauge of your effort in relation to your best effort.\n\nThe volume is referring to the sets and reps that are performed.\n\nArbitrarily this tends to be discussed with one week as the time frame. This is truly arbitrary since some training splits don’t even get all of the muscles trained within that one week time. That said, the majority of splits do tend to complete their cycle of workouts within the 7 day time frame and therefore this is used as a reference point for discussion.\n\nWhere things get a little more confusing and interesting at the same time is when the volume discussion starts to split out into the amount required by one muscle group vs. another. There is still a lot of conflicting information here. The bigger, broader question however of total volume on average needed for a muscle group to grow needs to be answered.\n\nCurrently, research points us to very differing opinions on this number. Some of the greatest strength and conditioning researchers in the world have concluded that total sets as low as 6 per muscle group can be effective in creating overload and stimulus for new muscle growth. Other, newer research indicates that more is better…a lot more. Some have argued that the ideal amount of volume for building muscle is upwards of 45 sets per muscle, per week. This seems like an insanely high amount of sets and reps performed in order to grow muscle.\n\nAdd to that that in these studies, each of the sets performed was taken to failure. \n\nAs you’ll see in this video, the interplay between volume and intensity is real. I say all the time, you can either train hard or you can train long but you can’t do both. If the volume is incredibly high, then the intensity is going to have to be low in order to allow you to make gains and recover in between workouts without breaking down. On the contrary, if you train at a super high intensity, then the volume has to be low in order to prevent overtraining and muscle breakdown to a point of irreparable damage. \n\nWhat makes the high volume side of the equation a poor approach is the amount of junk volume that comes along with it. Sure, the higher number of sets and reps performed makes it easier to ensure that you are getting adequate workout volume to stimulate new muscle tissue. That said, if the junk volume that comes along with it is also having a detrimental effect on your joint health and recovery, then it is potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nLikewise, if the effort is so high that you cannot properly recover or that your workout frequency has to be spread so far apart that you are performing far fewer workouts in a calendar year for example, then you are providing yourself fewer opportunities for muscle protein synthesis. Neither place represents an ideal spot to try and make gains with in your training.\n\nThe solution, as is often the case, lies in the middle. In the case of the X diagram shown in this video, that is where you want to be. Stimulating with enough sets and reps while still not delving into the area of useless reps. This is where drop sets and effective rep training (as was demonstrated in my 100 series workouts) is effective for building muscle while maximizing effort. \n\nIf you find this approach to be intriguing and want to learn more, head to athleanx.com via the link below and get the new Beaxst PPL program. It features a push, pull legs split where effective volume is the rule. We help you optimize the volume and intensity in your workouts to give you nothing but gains, leaving the pains for other programs.\n\nIf you are looking for a perfect chest workout, or more information on whether heavy weights or light weights are best for building muscle, be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel via the link below and turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it is published.",

        "title": "5 Big Mistakes ALL Noobs Make in the Gym!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/343-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want to avoid being called a \"noob\" in the gym then you need to figure out how to not make these 5 big mistakes. It starts with first distinguishing between a noob and a beginner however. People often think that all noobs are beginners and that is just not the case. Someone who is stuck in a stage where they get little results, especially when they have a lot of hours logged in the gym, is where we need to intervene and identify the biggest reasons why.\n\nThe first reason is that they rely too heavily on machines in the gym. This often starts out of insecurity and a lack of comfort lifting dumbbells and barbells in the more visible areas of the gym. It's normal for a newcomer to the gym to be a bit self conscious in a room surrounded by guys much bigger and experienced. \n\nThe machines provide a comfort level that just isn't there when you first start. The problem with this however is that they remove a lot of the important building blocks from the equation when just starting to work out. They limit the proprioceptive awareness that you'll need when you start to lift dumbbells and barbells. They also limit the development of coordination that is often needed for the bigger compound lifts. If you do wind up building some strength here, it can actually be a detriment since, when taken back to the more classic weighted lifts you don't have the actual strength and neurological skills listed above to execute the lift properly and safely. This winds up becoming dangerous and sets the stage for injury as you attempt to lift upon a cracked foundation.\n\nThe next big mistake is a lack of body awareness. Building off of the last point, when you don't know where your body is in space you can also not be able to appreciate which muscles are supposed to even be performing the lift you are doing. If you aren't aware which muscles are supposed to be firing to perform a lift it is easy to substitute momentum and limit the effectiveness of the exercise.\n\nIt's also very hard to learn how to recruit the proper muscles fully. Even if you knew which muscles were supposed to be working but didn't have an ability to contract them fully then you would be limiting your results due to a bad mind muscle connection with the muscle.\n\nThirdly, when the strength is lacking the range of motion suffers. This is common since we tend to want to perform the portion of a lift that we are confident we have the strength to perform in. Rather than lowering the weight to accommodate our strength in even our weakest range, we just either lift the weight that is too heavy or we limit the range to allow for what strength we do have. Either way, this is not an ideal strategy since it is one that will eventually be exposed down the road in the form of injury or unimpressive gains.\n\nThe next thing you want to be aware of is the order of the exercises that you are performing in your workouts. Most noobs randomly attack their workouts, opting to perform them in whatever order they feel like at any given moment. This is not ideal if you are looking for maximum muscle gains. Instead, you want to be sure your biggest lifts (the compound exercises) are performed not only when you have the most energy but before allowing any isolation exercises to fatigue your performance in the gym on those big lifts.\n\nIf you start off your workouts with small isolation exercises and then start to perform your big lifts (and the ones that require often times the most coordination and freshness) then you will likely never lift the type of weight that is possible here due to fatigue that was avoidable. \n\nThe next big mistake is not knowing when to switch things up. This can come in the form of switching it up too early or not switching it up enough. The issue is just not having enough experience to know when a change is necessary. And here we hit upon a very important point. It's not uncommon to hear that minimalism and just a few exercises is all you need to get bigger. That's true. But if your exercises are devoid of progressive overload in any form then you are better off just switching up your exercises instead. \n\nThe very fact that the new exercise can provide a novel stimulus is often enough to provide some reason for adaptation and response in the form of muscle growth. Of course, change for the sake of change is not the ultimate goal, learning how to progressively overload is.\n\nIf you want to remove your noob status once and for all, you're going to want a plan. You can find them at athleanx.com via the link below. Start training like an athlete today and remove all the guesswork from your workouts so you can make steady, impressive gains year in and year out.\n\nIf you haven't done so, remember to subscribe to our channel via the link below.

        "title": "The REAL Reason Your Lats Won't Grow!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - https://athleanx.com/x/342-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you ever wondered what the real reason your lats won’t grow is, this is a must watch video. Here I am going to show you what you likely have been and have not been doing when it comes to your back training that is leading to you not getting the back gains that you’re looking for. With just some simple modifications to your workouts, you will be on your way to building bigger lats.\n\nThe first thing you have probably been doing when it comes to your back workouts is that you’ve only been lifting heavy weights. This usually comes in the forms of rows, lat pulldowns, and weighted pullups. There’s nothing wrong with performing these exercises with heavier weights, but you are likely relying on something that comes with the heavy weight, especially in back training, and that is momentum.\n\nMomentum is easy to take advantage of with back training in comparison to pushing exercises such as the bench press or a seated overhead press. In those two cases, if you can’t push the weight up, it’s not going anywhere. With a row or lat pulldown, you can use some body english and momentum to move that weight when you normally might not be able to.\n\nWhile this can be helpful for building top end strength in the lifts that require it and may have given you some size to go along with that strength, the size of your lats might not have reached their full potential yet. This likely also has to do with the fact that you are also cutting short the range of motion in order to be able to manipulate that weight in space.\n\nSo, knowing that we are limiting our lat development based on the use of momentum and a shortened range of motion, we can introduce ways to fix these shortcomings. \n\nFirst, let’s look at decreasing the weight we are using with our back workouts. While you might think that lowering the weight is counterintuitive, it’s actually going to be more beneficial than you realize. By lowering the weight, you will be able to have better command of it in space to create a greater stretch and contraction - realizing the benefits of full range of motion. With full range of motion of the lats, you can better unlock muscle growth by tapping not into just a greater contraction, but also achieving a greater stretch.\n\nNow, when it comes to using lighter weights with your back workouts, it becomes even more essential that you start training your lats to failure in the higher rep ranges. I’ve mentioned before that as the rep range increases to include more than 12 reps, the more important it is that you train to failure on that exercise. Doing so will actually lead to better gains and more hypertrophy in the muscles you are trying to target.\n\nWe can also modify our training to not only include lighter weights, but utilize exercises that take your lats through full range of motion. The first exercise I like to mention is the rocking lat pulldown. This unilateral version of a standard pulldown allows for a greater contraction of the lats by being able to abduct the target arm.\n\nThe kneeling one armed pulldown is another great unilateral option for targeting the lats that will require even lighter weight to be used since you don’t have the assistance of the other arm to initiate the movement like you do in the rocking pulldown.\n\nNext, we have the one arm high cable row (of my favorite back exercises of all time). Not only does this exercise allow you to target one side at a time, but the nature of the exercise takes you through full range of motion and a hard contraction with the elbow tight against the body as well allowing you put the muscle on full stretch at the top of each rep.\n\nAnother exercise option for your next back workout is the straight arm pushdown. Another exercise that allows you to target the lats effectively through a good contraction and allowing for the lats to be put on stretch at the top end in the range of motion while sitting the hips back. A slight tweak you can make to this exercise to further enhance the stretch on the lats is to simply perform this exercise in a kneeling position.\n\nLastly, an alternative to the standard pulldown to grow your lats is the underhanded version. Simply changing the orientation of your hands on the bar is enough to create to accentuate the stretch that you get on the lats at the top of the rep - again, going after that range of motion!\n\nIf you are looking for a complete workout program that help you to build bigger lats if you struggle to build them now, then be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below and use the program selector to find the training plan that matches your exact goals now.\n\nIf you’re looking for more videos on how to build a bigger back, be sure to click on the link below to subscribe to this channel here on YouTube and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "How to Fix Slumped Posture (NO MORE SLOUCHING!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/341-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wondered how to fix slumped posture? In this video, I am going to show you why you suffer from slumped posture and how to fix it so that you can stop slouching once and for all.\n\nIt starts first by identifying what is causing your bad posture in the first place. You are most likely slouching with rounded shoulders due to a weakness and lack of mobility in your upper back, specifically the thoracic spine. Not only is it causing your shoulders to round forward, but it is also affecting the posterior pelvic tilt that you are likely suffering from as well.\n\nWhile some may argue that your posture doesn’t matter, as a physical therapist, I disagree. I find that posture can affect everyone both inside and out of the gym. If you don’t believe me, try this out; slump forward, slump forward and allow your shoulders to round. Then, try raising your arm up overhead. You won’t be able to get it all the way up. Your humerus will actually get blocked within the shoulder joint, preventing you from being able to raise it all the way overhead.\n\nIf you are someone who works out, that means that with this bad posture you will run into difficulty to effectively press weight overhead, such as with dumbbells or a barbell. In everyday life, you might find it difficult to put something away above you because of the difficulty in getting your arms up. \n\nNow, to feel what it would be like to stand with good posture, stand in front of a straight line and turn your toes out. Contract your quads and squeeze your glutes together. From here, make fist and place it against your chest with your thumb resting on your sternum. You should notice a slight downward tilt of your knuckles. Now, retract your shoulder blades and raise your chest upwards, bringing those knuckles to parallel to the ceiling. \n\nSince you know what it feels like to stop slouching and to stand in good posture, it’s time to implement the fix, which is a daily 5 minute routine consisting of just 5 simple exercises. Two exercises to strengthen and mobilize the thoracic spine and two exercises to work on the strength-endurance of the glutes. It’s not just about having a glutes that are strong, but having the ability to hold them in the right position for an extended period of time. There is also a combination exercise that will target both the thoracic spine and the glutes all in one move.\n\nPerform the posture fix routine as follows:\n\nA. Supermans x 30 sec\nB. Glute Bridge Marches x 30 sec\nA. Supermans x 30 sec\nB. Glute Bridge Marches x 30 sec\nE. Bridge and Reach Overs x 30 sec\n\nC. Kneeling Thoracic Drops x 30 sec\nD. Wall DL’s x 30 sec (right leg)\nC. Kneeling Thoracic Drops x 30 sec\nD. Wall DL’s x 30 sec (left leg)\nE. Bridge and Reach Overs x 30 sec\n\nThe Supermans exercise is a thoracic strengthening exercise that will help target the muscles of the upper back and in-between the shoulder blades. Weakness in these muscles allows for the upper back to round forward, taking with it the shoulders, causing them to round as well. To have good posture, you need to make sure these muscles are strong enough to keep you upright.\n\nThe Glute Bridge Marches will work on the strength endurance of the glutes. It is important to note here that you want to avoid any dropping of the hips / pelvis at any point, whether than be sagging down or tilting to one side in order to raise the other leg off the ground.\n\nKneeling Thoracic Drops will work on mobilizing the thoracic spine and as an added bonus, will help stretch the lats, which we know are an internal rotator of the shoulders. If these muscles are too tight, they will actually assist in pulling your shoulders forward.\n\nBy performing the Wall DL’s you will be getting good activation of the glutes through their function of hip extension. When your knee comes forward and reaches the wall, you want to make sure that the standing leg allows for the hips to reach all the way through and forward.\n\nOne of my favorite exercises to help correct bad posture and to feel amazing every single day is the Bridge and Reach Over. This posture exercise not only targets mobility of the thoracic spine with the reach over to each side, but doubles as a glute strengthening exercise by having you perform a bridge with each repetition.\n\nIf you’re looking for a complete workout program that will fix your posture but also help you to build a ripped athletic body, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the plans that are best suited to your current goals. \n\nFor more videos on how to fix your posture and a daily posture routine that you can follow, be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "How Many Reps to Build Muscle (COMMON MISTAKE)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/340-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nWhen it comes to working out and building muscle, I need you to stop counting reps. In this video, I am going to explain why counting the number of reps you are doing, as well as your rep range goals, is counterintuitive to the gains that you are seeking. There is something that you should be doing instead that will help you to get the most out of every workout that you do.\n\nBy targeting a specific number of reps, you are setting yourself up for subpar results and lower quality repetitions. So, instead of thinking how many reps you are going to do to build muscle, I want you to think about generalities; in general I can pick up a weight that is heavy enough to fall in the 1-7 rep range. The next rep range requires a moderate weight that falls within 8-14. A lighter weight would have me looking for 15-30 repetitions. The last number of reps, above 30 reps, requires a super light weight.\n\nEvery single one of these ranges will build muscle. In the lowest rep range, the benefit that I get is that there is extremely high tension which means that I do not have to go to absolute failure. I can increase muscle growth thanks to that tension. As your rep range increases, failure is even more important as tension starts to go down.\n\nFailure is defined as not being able to perform a rep of an exercise in good form. That means, if you were performing a curl; you are not doing what looks like a good morning in order to swing the weight up.\n\nIn terms of getting to a specific rep number, our body often self-corrects. If we achieve a difficult rep lower than the number goal, then we start to shortchange or cheat our next reps until we reach that last number. By doing this, you are leaving gains on the table. Instead of performing effective receptions throughout the entirety of the set, you are limiting the number of them that you are doing.\n\nIf I chose a weight that causes me to fail absolutely in the rep range that I am looking for, we know that the overload for growth is going to occur in the last 3 or so reps. However, when it comes to effective reps in these ranges, it doesn’t mean that the early reps can’t be effective too. In fact, these can be extremely effective if you a performing each rep with good intention to create a more solid mind-muscle-connection. By establishing a better mind-muscle-connection, you can better perform the later reps for overload. When you are trying to get better at performing an exercise, that connection between the brain and the muscle in order to better feel the muscles that you are working.\n\nNot only that, but you will have a better feeling of what failure is and be able to utilize those last few reps to create the overload necessary for muscle growth. So, don’t think that the early reps are just throw away reps - use them to get better at the exercise so that you can better perform each repetition, especially as you get closer and closer to failure. This will make those last, effective reps, even more effective.\n\nAgain, it is extremely important to think about these rep ranges as generalities. Instead of focusing on a specific number, a mindset that will leave you with subpar results, you want to focus on the intention of each rep. When I head into my workouts, I don’t look for the reps that I am doing; I am looking to reach a range based on the weight I am choosing and taking it to failure.\n\nI mentioned earlier that you can still build muscle in the rep range above 30 repetitions. With such light weight, the tension is extremely low as well. In this case, you need to incur a large amount of volume. With low intensity, volume is important to build muscle. \n\nIt doesn’t matter what rep range you choose to work towards, you can still build muscle. The important aspect of each one, however, is to make sure that you are putting in a high level of effort into each repetition. I’ve always said to stop counting reps, but make the reps count. With high intention comes the most muscle gains as you create a greater mind-muscle-connection with your earlier reps and a tension overload in the later reps of the range you are working within.\n\nFor a science-backed workout program that explains how to make each repetition effective to build ripped athletic muscle, make sure to head to the ATHLEAN-X website using the link below and find the program that is best suited to match your training goals.\n\nFor more videos on how to build muscle most effectively, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "You DON'T Need to Stretch (NEW RESEARCH)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/339-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nDid you know that there is new research available that shows you don’t need to stretch to increase flexibility and joint range of motion? In this video, I am going to show you how you can ditch your boring static stretching routine (that you’re probably not even doing in the first place) and can replace it with something that is simple and easy to follow.\n\nWhat this new research shows is that traditional strength training is just as beneficial as traditional static stretching when it comes increasing a person’s flexibility and joint range of motion. So, that means that if you were dreading adding a few extra minutes to your routine in order to go through some uncomfortable static stretching, I have another option for you.\n\nWhen it comes to stretching and flexibility, some will argue that it is the most important thing that you can do. In fact, they might call it the “fountain of youth.” I’m not going to argue its importance, but I too find myself often skipping it when short on time, especially since it is relegated to the end of the workout anyways. \n\nSo how do we replace the boring static stretch routine? Simple, we incorporate loaded stretching into our weight training routine - yes, you will still be doing SOME stretching, just not the kind you are probably used to doing. We can add these loaded stretches very easily by utilizing the contracted and stretched position of commonly performed exercises.\n\nNow to achieve the best stretch and to maximize flexibility and joint range of motion, you want to make sure you are hitting full range of motion of the muscle on each exercise. Going from fully stretched to fully contracted is the best way to do this and I am going to show you specific exercises that allow you to do this every time.\n\nThe first exercise that I want to highlight is the lat pulldown. When incorporating the stretch aspect of the exercise, I like to use the v-handle as it allows me to get my elbows out in front to increase the stretch on the lats. When you perform this back exercise, allow yourself to hang out for a few seconds in the stretch position at the top of the rep. You should really be able to feel your lats getting a good stretch in this position which is good feedback for each rep.\n\nNext up is the cable crossover for your chest. This exercise is awesome for achieving what we want to do in terms of flexibility because not only are we able to go from a good stretch position to start each rep, opening the chest and getting those shoulders back, but we can hit adduct the arms across midline too. While the pecs are stretched to start, at the end they need to be fully contracted. \n\nThen we move on to the triceps with an overhead cable extension. This exercise not only allows you to get your arms up and behind your body to get maximum stretch on the long head of the triceps, but will also help to achieve a good, tall standing posture at the end of each rep. Hang out in that stretch position for a few seconds and really feel your triceps working.\n\nWe can get a good stretch on the biceps too, this time with an incline dumbbell curl. By leaning back and getting our forearms into a pronated position, we are making sure that biceps are elongated with load (that being the dumbbells in hand). To really get the most out of this loaded stretch, when you reach the top of the curl, give a little shoulder flexion too so that you take the biceps through full range of motion.\n\nNext, to apply what we’ve been doing to the hamstrings and glutes, you are going to use a simple dumbbell Romanian deadlift. You are going to want to use dumbbells during this exercise because, like the rest, the loading of the stretch is meant to be light. We are not seeking out hypertrophy so the weight is drastically decreased.\n\nFor the quads, we go back to the dumbbell bulgarian split squat. This exercise is a great choice because it allows you to stretch the quad of one leg while getting a quad AND hip flexor stretch on the other leg. Not only that, at the top of the rep you can get into hip extension as well. This is a great way to apply loaded stretching to the quads.\n\nTo target the hard-to-hit middle delts when it comes to stretching, a simple PNF pattern known as the cable sword raise is the choice for me. Getting the arm across your body with load is the important part here, remembering to hold this stretch for a few seconds at a time before completing each rep.\n\nFor a science-backed workout program to help you build ripped athletic muscle, be sure to head to the ATHLEAN-X website via the link below and find the program best suited to match your goals.\n\nFor more videos on stretching and to get more flexible, be sure to subscribe our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "The 💯 Arm Workout (MOST EFFECTIVE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/338-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThe one hundred arm workout requires all out effort, but the results are nothing short of amazing if you follow the biceps and triceps exercises and protocols shown here. As always a solid arm workout should consist of exercises for your biceps and triceps but also not forget to hit those other arm muscles like the brachialis and forearm muscles.  That said, even that doesn’t make this workout for arms complete.  In order to fill up your shirt sleeves with a well rounded workout you need to spend more time focusing on the reps that actually count to help you get bigger arms. That is what we do in this workout.\n\nIf you look at most arm workouts people perform, they usually consist of the same arm exercises. The issue isn’t necessarily what you’re doing but how you’re doing them. In order to increase the intensity of the workouts you are doing you have to focus on increasing the intensity of each set you perform. Consider that in a normal set of 12 reps that only the last 2-3 are actually hard enough to provide enough stimulus for muscle growth.\n\nWhat if you had a way that allowed you to more quickly tap into those harder, more growth producing reps more quickly? You do, by incorporating a rest pause technique into your training. Here, when the set is resumed you are instantly back to recruiting more type II fibers which are more easily able to respond to your hard work in the form of new size. The accumulation of these more difficult, effective reps is what can easily help you to increase the size of your arms while decreasing the length of your workout.\n\nWith the arm workout technique shown here and in this series, you’re going to more quickly intensify your training and lead to faster growth in your arms. \n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n\nPerform a set of the biceps or triceps exercises shown below to 12 rep failure. Choose a weight that will cause you to fail at or close to the 12 rep mark. Keep in mind, failure is the inability to perform another concentric repetition without sacrificing form to the point where the exercise either becomes unsafe or unrecognizable. This is called the ignition set. At this point, the real work begins. Rest for just 15 seconds as part of a somewhat prolonged rest/pause. As soon as these 15 seconds are up, get back into another set. You will instantly recognize that the reps will be challenging more quickly due to the decreased recovery time allowed. \n\nYou are still using the same load however, therefore your arms are still being subjected to the same external load. However many reps you get after each of these rest/pause increments are all deemed to be effective reps. Each bout should be taken to failure. Accumulate 20 effective reps (or in some cases below, 10 reps), even if you’re getting just 1 out at a time until your work on that exercise is complete. \n\nIf for some reason you are unable to complete any more reps on your way to 20, end your set and aim to complete all 20 the next time you perform this workout.\n\nHere is how to construct the 100 arm workout with that in mind.\n\nBarbell Curls - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\nDB JM Press - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\nDB Cross Body Hammer Curls - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\nTriceps Pushdowns - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause\n\nWeighted Upright Dips - Ignition Set into 10 Effective Reps of Paused Upright Dips as a Rest/Pause\n\nBiceps Chin Ups - Ignition Set into 10 Effective Reps of Negative Chin Hangs as a Rest/Pause\n\nOptional: Hell in a Hundred x 100 reps Banded Biceps Curls with Banded Overhead Triceps Extensions\n\nAll totaled, this will amount to 100 effective reps in this intense arm workout with the finisher as an option for those who are truly looking for a workout that will blast their arms and might require new t-shirts.\n\nIf you have to adjust your weights down as the fatigue mounts, do so accordingly. You are not necessarily using your 12 rep max on an exercise, you are using a weight that will cause you to fail at the 12 rep mark in that given workout. Fatigue accumulating in the later arm exercises of this workout may cause you to have to drop down a bit to make this happen throughout the workout.\n\nThis is just one example of how to apply science to your arm workouts.  If you want to train like an athlete you want to put science back in every workout you do.  You can do that with the ATHLEAN-X Training Programs available at http://athleanx.com and get started right away on building a ripped, muscular, athletic body.\n\nFor more arm workout videos for the biceps and triceps be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at the link above and don’t forget to turn on notifications so you never miss one when it’s published.",

        "title": "How to Get a Bigger Chest Fast (JUST DO THIS!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/337-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you ever wanted to get a bigger chest fast, it’s easier than you thought. In this video, I am going to show you how to grow your chest fast with two simple tips that can be applied to your very next chest workout to help you get bigger pecs.\n\nWhether you have a hard time putting more size on your chest or you are not genetically gifted with a large, barrel chest like Arnold, these two tips are going to be a game changer for you. As someone who has struggled to grow their chest, I know the struggle of trying everything to make a difference, but I guarantee this will help.\n\nFirst up, you want to make sure that you are allowing your chest to dominate the movement. Often, we allow the shoulders to take over the brunt of the work of a chest exercise which takes away from the development that we are looking for. To do this, you want to make sure that your chest is more prominent on each exercise that you do and my cue for you to apply to your very next set, is to raise your sternum. \n\nWe are often told to bring our shoulders back, but I don’t think that that is enough. If you are consciously aware of the position that your sternum is in, you will notice that the more that you raise it and try to make it more prominent - the more activation you will be getting from each rep.\n\nThe second adjustment that you need to make, is to press through the inside of your hand. You want to press through the index finger and thumb, having them “lead the way” on each chest exercise. This will actually put your arm and shoulder in better position to allow your chest to dominate the movement as opposed to your shoulders. By leading with the inside portion of your hand, your shoulders will naturally become second fiddle to your chest on your pressing exercises.\n\nLeading with your index finger and thumb on every chest exercise will also allow you to get your sternum and chest in the most advantageous position to allow for more chest growth. So, if we can get our chest out and shoulders back, we are putting ourselves in the best spot to grow a bigger chest.\n\nHow do we apply this to our chest workouts?\n\nLet’s start with the popular chest exercise the dumbbell bench press. Laying on the bench, try to raise your sternum as high in the air as you can towards the ceiling and allow your shoulders to retract. This will let your chest take over the exercise and help to minimize the contribution of the shoulders. From here, when you press the dumbbells up, lead with your thumb and index finger, almost tilting the dumbbells.\n\nNothing too different on a cable crossover. Square up, allowing the chest to stand in front of the shoulder to start the exercise. Think about raising that sternum so that you don’t hollow out when you bring your arm out and across your body. Then, like you did on the last chest exercise, lead with the inside of your grip to make sure your shoulders stay out of the movement as much as possible.\n\nWhat about the pushup, you might ask. These two adjustments apply here too. Think about attacking the ground with your sternum, especially when you reach the bottom of the rep. You can even perform a hand-release pushup to reinforce this concept. When you press your body up off the groudn, you not only want to continue to stick your chest out towards the ground, but again press through the inside off your hands like you would on the other chest exercises. \n\nSo often, when it comes to someone struggling to build a big chest, they are making the same mistake over and over again. I would say it’s even more often than not happening to the lanky and skinny guys out there, just because of their body proportions. By allowing the shoulders to become so readily involved in every chest exercise, the chest is taking on less of the work than it needs to in order to grow. By applying these two techniques to your very next chest workout, you will allow yourself an opportunity to grow a bigger chest fast. \n\nGive it a shot and feel the difference for yourself!\n\nIf you want a step by step program for how to get a bigger chest fast, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the programs available. Each one will help you to build up the size of your chest while training your whole body athletically and getting you to build ripped, lean muscle. \n\nFor more videos on how to build a big chest and how to get bigger pecs fast, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "BRUTAL PULL WORKOUT | Torn Biceps and All!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/336-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want a brutal pull workout that will train your lats, biceps and upper back all in one training session, then you’re going to want to watch this video. I perform this workout as a full length pull workout follow along with Jesse in a local gym, and I don’t let my torn biceps hold me back. This is something that the viewers have asked for for a long time, and now here it is. Many people think of back and biceps when performing a pull workout. That is predominantly correct but you do not want to forget about the other muscles of the arm and upper back that also need attention. \n\nWe start this pull workout with pullups, but not any kind of pullups. You see, I believe that one of the bigger mistakes I made as a younger trainee was concentrating on building up the number of reps I could do on pull-ups without focusing early enough on adding more weight. After a couple warmup sets of bodyweight pullups I go right with the weighted pullup variation. Here, we do a few sets training close to failure on every set.\n\nWe also take the opportunity to do drop sets as well. Perform a set of weighted pullups and immediately strip away the weight and then hop right back up on the bar and rep out the bodyweight version until failure once again.\n\nNext up is the chest supported row. The particular machine I’m using here is called the humbler. Why? Because the amount of weight that you can use on it is less than what you may think you could use. It does such a good job of isolating the back muscles and taking the lower back out of it that you are forced to use more of the muscles you are trying to train. Once again, we use a few different intensity techniques to make this brutal pull workout even harder.\n\nOn my last set, Jesse is assisting with lifting the weight through the positive part of the rep and allowing me to focus mostly on the slow eccentric part of the rep. This has a great stimulus for muscle growth due to the prolonged time under tension and the muscle damage that can be incurred through slow eccentrics.\n\nNext is the lat pulldown. Typically, I prefer the underhand variation of the move when it’s included in a pull workout. That said, with my torn right biceps I have to be a little conscientious of this and make the necessary adaptation. This involves using a bar that allows me to take a slightly more neutral grip. The decrease in supination can take some of the strain off the biceps and let me focus more on pulling with the lats and mid back. \n\nAgain here, we take the opportunity to intensify the sets in this pull workout by performing some slow negatives at the end of the sets performed on this exercise.\n\nI’ll purposely increase the weight on the stack and perform a bit of a cheat on the concentric part of the lift just to put myself into position for another overloaded negative.\n\nWe move onto the biceps and brachialis at this point. One of my favorite ways to train the biceps is with a standing alternating dumbbell curl. That said, again I have to make some considerations for my torn biceps. Instead of grabbing equal weight and letting the weakness of the right arm dictate the load that my healthy arm has to lift, I simply grab two different weights.\n\nIn general, I have about a 10% decrease in strength in the right arm vs the left arm on my direct biceps exercises.\n\nThe brachialis is then targeted with a hammer curl variation. Instead of doing a typical neutral grip hammer curl I can increase the focus by taking a fully pronated position of the forearm. This is called a cross body hammer curl. Once again, I look for an opportunity to perform some drop sets towards the end of the working sets for this great pull exercise. \n\nFinally, no pull workout is complete without my favorite exercise, and the one with pull in it’s name - face pulls! Here you want to see if you can grab two ropes to perform it. The additional rope allows you to get into a better arm position at the contracted position of every rep.\n\nFinish up with some overhead raises on the face pulls to make sure that you are increasing the time under tension and treating each and every rep as a focused contraction.\n\nHere is a recap of the exercises shown in this pull workout:\n\nWeighted Pullups\nChest Supported Rows\nNeutral Gip Lat Pulldowns\nStanding Alternating Dumbbell Curls\nCross Body Hammer Curls\nFacepulls\n\nIf you like this pull workout and are looking for a variation of this that you can try yourself, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out our AX1 program.

        "title": "Build Big Triceps with Bands (NO WEIGHTS!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/335-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want to build big triceps with bands and didn’t think it was possible, then this is the video for you. Here, I am going to show you the best way to build bigger triceps using just resistance bands and no weights. In times of gym closures and an increase in the number of people doing home triceps workouts, having a resource for the best band exercises for triceps is going to help you to meet your goals without having to compromise.\n\nAll of these triceps exercises can be done with one to two sets of resistance bands. It is a good idea to have varying resistance levels of them so you can introduce more exercises.\n\nThe first exercise shown is the banded standing dip. While you can certainly use a band as additional resistance when performing an upright dip (either using dip bars or a kitchen counter corner,) the benefit of this exercise is to mimic the dip movement without needing somewhere to suspend yourself in air. Using a heavier resistance band will allow you to overload your triceps even more.\n\nThe next triceps exercise is the banded JM press. A great exercise that can be performed with a barbell or dumbbells can also be accomplished using nothing but a resistance band. An added benefit of this version of the exercise is that you don’t even need a bench to do it; you can simply wrap the band around your back and lay on the floor.\n\nSome of the best triceps exercises you can do are bodyweight based, such as pushup variations, but what if you could make those exercises better? Well we can do just that by adding a band to include some extra resistance on those movements. With the diamond cutter pushup, we can do just that by wrapping a band around our back and getting down to the floor. Make sure to keep those elbows tight your body as you perform each rep in order to get the most out of the triceps.\n\nOne of my favorite triceps exercises, the db lying triceps extensions, can actually be modified to fit our needs as a banded triceps exercise too. To perform the banded lying extensions, lay on the ground with the band attached to a low anchor point, and allow the arms to extend back over your head. When you reach the top portion of the rep, you will feel more tension on the triceps than normal as the resistance of the band is acting perpendicular to the forearms whereas in the standard version, the weight of the dumbbells and gravity are acting parallel to the forearms.\n\nAmongst exercises for triceps, the kickback is not beloved by all. However, the banded kickback shouldn’t be overlooked. With an overload of resistance from the band on the long head of the triceps in its peak contracted state, this banded exercise allows for a new opportunity for triceps growth.\n\nThe banded overhead extension takes the db power bomb exercise and introduces a difference in the resistance curve of the exercise that makes it worth trying. When performed with a dumbbell, there is less tension on the triceps when at the top end of the exercises. However, when doing it with a band, the resistance is greatest at the top, making it the perfect compliment to an already great exercise.\n\nThe banded woodchopper pushdown allows not only for extra body english to use heavier-resisted band, but also allows you to get your arm further back behind your body - giving the opportunity for greater contraction on the triceps. It’s a great way to mimic a heavily weighted triceps pushdown with a little extra benefit.\n\nThe banded pushaway plus takes the triceps pushaway and adds a little extra to it. Once you reach the overhead position, hold your arms there and take a step away from the band. This added isometric overload on the triceps is a great way to add a little extra resistance to an otherwise good option.\n\nWe can take the same exercise and add in a little extra conditioning effect with a very dynamic movement called the twisting lunge and pushaway. Use a low anchor point, lunge, and press. This will not only hit your triceps but will also give you more global conditioning benefits as well.\n\nOne of my favorite bodyweight options for hitting the triceps is the cobra pushup, but adding a band makes it that much better. Adding that extra resistance with the band overloads the triceps further to stimulate hypertrophy.\n\nIf you are looking for resistance band workouts to build ripped athletic muscle, be sure to click the link below to check out our 90 day resistance band only training program called ELAST-X.\n\nFor more videos on getting big triceps with limited equipment, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/334-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you ever thought of having a back like bane, this is the back workout you will want to follow. It can take even the most bony of backs right now and help build them into much thicker, denser bands of muscle like the popular Batman villain played by Tom Hardy. Now, the key to building a thick back is to perform exercises that focus less on width and v-taper and more on the front to back depth that you get from working on the mid back muscles.\n\nIn this back workout, you’re going to get a chance to use back exercises that are highly capable of developing the look you are after.\n\nI’m going to present the exercises in this workout in the form of a choice. I want you to be able to think your way through your options to select the best back exercises for building up a bane back. The reason is, most of us are programmed to want to perform the same exercises over and over. The issue is, while they are all incredibly effective back exercises and can all help you to build a bigger back, some are better than others when it comes to building thicker, dense lats and back muscles.\n\nSo with that, we start with an important note. If you truly want to build the thickest back possible you are going to need to start deadlifting. There is no better exercise for creating back muscle density than the deadlift.\n\nThis doesn’t have to be a lift that is performed in your back workout however. In fact, Jesse used the deadlift as an exercise to build a bigger back by devoting a single day of lifting to it. He would also work it into his leg training as well. The point is, wherever you are programming it right now (even if on back day - which is totally acceptable) you’ll want to make sure you’re doing it.\n\nNow, to kick off the back workout we start with the straight arm pushdown. Most of the time, this isolation back exercise is placed at the end of your workout for a dense back. This is going to change here. In order to pre-fatigue the lats and make the mid and upper back muscles do more of the work during this workout, we are going to put them first. Check the details at the end of this video for specific sets and reps on the exercise.\n\nNext, we move onto the pulldown. The choice is between the straight bar pulldown or the v-handle pulldown. Well, when your goal is to build middle back thickness and muscular density you are going to want to opt for the close grip v-handle. Think about squeezing the shoulder blades down and together on every rep rather than just getting the handle to your chest.\n\nNext is the pullup. Here again you have a choice. If you can do more than 10 pullups in a single set then I think your focus should be to start adding weight rather than more reps. Far too often the goal on this exercise becomes just higher rep counts. This isn’t ideal. Instead, add even a little bit of extra weight and start building up the thickness of your back a lot faster. Drop down to bodyweight sets after reaching failure for more volume if needed.\n\nThe next exercise is the row. Here you are going to want to opt for the chest supported variation. The idea again is to use a little less weight and let the lats do less of the work for you. You can make this even more possible by flaring the elbows out to the sides and letting them drift a big higher. This will shift the focus off of the lats and more to the upper scapular muscles and rhomboids.\n\nThe cable row is next, and ideally should be done standing if you want to build a bane back. The dual handles allow you to get your elbows further behind your body for a better contraction. The standing position demands that you maintain strong posture from your hips to your shoulders - working more back muscles in the process.\n\nFinally, the traps are worked with a version of the shrug. Instead of the standard barbell shrug however think about starting every rep off the floor. This will work the erector muscles again (much like the deadlift, but with much lighter loads) and help to reinforce the thickness of the paraspinal muscles that are contributing to the overall back density. The shrug is still the same at the top of every rep which is going to build that big upper back that Bane was known for.\n\nIf you’re looking for a complete program that trains more than just your back to develop thick, dense athletic muscle, be sure to head to athleanx.com and use the program selector to find the program that is best suited to your current goals.\n\nFor more videos on how to build thick upper traps like Tom Hardy or the best back exercises ranked, be sure to remember to subscribe to our youtube channel via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "5 Best Triceps Exercises You're NOT Doing!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/333-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you’re looking for the best triceps exercises outside of the ones you’re already doing to build your triceps, then you’ve come to the right place. In this video, I’m going to show you the 5 best triceps exercises you’re not doing right now to help you get bigger triceps and fill your shirt sleeves.\n\nIf you have been relying on the close grip bench press to overload your triceps with heavier weights, but it’s still not giving you the tricep size that you’re looking for, then you are going to want to try the PJR Pullover. This exercise will effectively target the long head of the triceps since you are putting them on stretch by getting your arms back behind your head. However, you will be able to use heavier weight thanks to the assistance of the lats during this movement as well as the use of a single dumbbell instead of the having the manipulate two in space.\n\nFor those looking for a bodyweight option outside of just continuously doing pushup variations, you are going to want to try the Triceps Trunk Lift. This triceps exercise forces you to get your arms into extension behind your body as you come up off the ground, creating a great overload in the contracted position of the muscle. Most bodyweight triceps exercises, especially pushup variations, won’t have you reaching this level of contraction on the long head of the triceps because they lack the ability to bring the arm into extension. If you don’t have access to any equipment, this is a great option to add to your triceps workout.\n\nIf you look at almost any traditional triceps workout, the triceps pushdown is likely going to be included. The only drawback of this exercise is the fact you are limited in how much you can get your arm back into extension behind the body to achieve peak contraction on the triceps. You can fix this by trying Rotational Pushdowns. This variation will prevent the bar from stopping the movement when it reaches your body, as it will now be going to the side as you adduct your arm behind your body. Going back and forth to each side will mean you don’t have to spend each set focusing on doing a single arm pushdown.\n\nAs a bonus, I am including a mechanical drop-set that is made up of 3 great triceps exercises. Perform Lying Triceps Extensions to failure, then immediately start performing the JM Press until you reach failure yet again. Immediately proceed to start doing the Elbows Tucked Bench Press to failure. This sequence will allow you to take your triceps to and through failure as the exercises get mechanically easier with each drop.\n\nIf you find that the Lying Triceps Extension is uncomfortable on your shoulders, I have a similar triceps exercise that you can add in as a substitute called the JM Extension. It’s a mix of the JM Press and the Lying Triceps Extension, as you could probably tell. While starting off in the position of a JM Press, instead of pressing the dumbbells up, you are pressing them up and back into extension. By not getting your hands all the way behind your head, you are taking some of that stress off your shoulders and thus you can focus on your triceps training without any discomfort.\n\nSpeaking of triceps extension, there is one way we can perform this exercise that you likely haven’t thought of before… and that’s with a cable. The Lying Cable Extension allows you to achieve overload in the contracted position that using dumbbells wouldn’t allow for. Why? When the arms are straight up at the end of the movement, gravity is acting parallel to the forearm and triceps, meaning that there is less tension on the muscles being worked. The cable allows for the line of resistance to act against the triceps at the top end of the range of motion of the exercise, putting more stress on the triceps.\n\nSo if you’ve been banging your head against the wall trying to build your triceps using all the most common and popular triceps exercises out there, then it might be time to try something new. Sometimes, changing the exercises that you do is all you need to spark new growth with the introduction of a new stimulus. Give these exercises a try and see just how well they work for you.\n\nIf you want to build not only better triceps but every muscle in your body faster, then you need to put the science behind every exercise and workout that you do, To get a step-by-step training program that does exactly that, check out our ATHLEAN-X Training System by visiting the link below.\n\nFor more videos on how to get bigger triceps and how to take your muscle gains to the next level - be sure to subscribe to our channel here on YouTube using the link below and don’t forget to turn on your notifications you never miss a new video when I put one out.",

        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/332-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThe one hundred shoulder workout requires all out effort, but the results are nothing short of incredible if you follow the shoulder exercises and protocols shown here. As always a complete shoulder workout should consist of exercises for your front delts, middle delts and rear delts.  That said, even that doesn’t make this workout for shoulders complete.  In order to round out your delts and create boulder shoulders you need to spend more time focusing on the reps that actually matter to help you build bigger shoulders. That is what we do in this intense shoulder workout.\n\nAs always, it’s important to define what training intensely looks like. When asked to train to failure in this shoulders workout, you want to be sure that you are still performing something that resembles the shoulder exercise that was intended. In other words, adopting poor form in order to squeeze out another concentric repetition is not allowed. You want to stop at the point when the breakdown of form starts to either short change your range of motion or introduce compensation that could turn the shoulder exercise into a risky one.\n\nAlso of importance for this 100 shoulder workout is the concept of rest pause. This means that after reaching fatigue at some point in the set of the exercise for shoulders that you’re performing, you are allowed a brief rest. In this case, just 15 seconds, in order to catch your breath and let some of the burn in the shoulder muscles subside momentarily. After resuming your reps in pursuit of your effective rep count, you ideally want to be able to do at least 1-2 reps. If for some reason you are unable to perform any reps, you can either stop the set at that point and build up towards completing your goal reps the next time you perform the workout or you simply rest a little bit longer during your intervals. \n\nSpeaking of effective reps, these are the ones that are commonly regarded as the most results producing that occur towards the end of any given set that require a much higher effort level in order to complete. Mind you, these do not need to happen at the point of failure but doing so ensures that you have adequately accessed the muscle fibers that are most responsible for this action and can grow bigger shoulders in the case of this shoulder workout.\n\nIn a typical workout for shoulders you wind up performing the majority of reps just to get to a point where you reach a level of challenge that is an adequate stimulus for shoulder muscle growth. In this type of workout, your front delts, side delts and rear delts will be subjected to on overload capable of stimulating bigger shoulders on almost every rep.\n\nAs for how to construct the 100 shoulder workout, here’s what your plan will look like:\n\nDB/BB Overhead Press - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps on Push Press as a Rest/Pause \n\nDB Side Lateral Raises - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps on Static Lateral Raises as a Rest/Pause \n\nDB Hip Huggers - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n\nCable Stretch Front Raises - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause\n\nOverhead Raise Face Pulls - Ignition Set into 20 Effective Reps on Face Pulls as a Rest/Pause\n\n\nAll totaled, this will amount to 100 effective reps in this intense shoulder workout.\n\nIf you have to adjust your weights down as the fatigue mounts, do so accordingly. You are not necessarily using your 12 rep max on an exercise, you are using a weight that will cause you to fail at the 12 rep mark in that given workout. Fatigue accumulating in the later shoulder exercises of this workout may cause you to have to drop down a bit to make this happen throughout the workout.\n\nThis is just one example of how to apply science to your shoulder workouts.  If you want to train like an athlete you want to put science back in every workout you do.  You can do that with the ATHLEAN-X Training Programs available at http://athleanx.com and get started right away on building a ripped, muscular, athletic body.\n\nFor more shoulder workout videos for the front delts, middle delts and rear delts, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube at the link above and don’t forget to turn on notifications so you never miss one when it’s published.",

        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/331-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThe hundred chest workout requires all out effort, but the results are nothing short of amazing if you follow the chest exercises and protocols shown here. As always a solid chest workout should consist of exercises for your upper chest, middle chest and lower chest.  That said, even that doesn’t make this workout for chest complete.  In order to round out your pecs with a well rounded workout you need to spend more time focusing on the reps that actually count to help you build a bigger chest. That is what we do in this workout.\n\nIf you look at the four main exercises that people do in their chest workouts you will see incline bench press, barbell bench press, dips and pushups.  Take a closer look into each of these basic chest exercises and you will see one thing in common.  That is, each of these exercises is lacking a full adduction of the shoulder within the exercise. As we did in the perfect chest workout, we are going to make sure we address this oversight but remain in the effective rep range for each as we make our way through this chest workout.\n\nRemember, just because you are going through a full range of motion on the chest exercises that you are doing it does not mean that you are taking a muscle through its full range of motion. In order to grow fuller pecs you are going to have to train with this in mind and be sure to include chest exercises that take your arm through different planes of motion.\n\nWhen it comes to training in the effective rep range, ask yourself a question. When you perform a set of any chest exercise, do you take it to failure or close to failure? Likely, the only reps you feel that are challenging are the final 1 to 3 reps. This is because, it is only at the point after the muscle has been stressed enough to tap into the harder to reach type IIb muscle fibers that the task at hand becomes challenging enough to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. \n\nIf you do not experience some type of tension overload, eccentric overload or metabolic damage during a set - it can be pretty well accepted that you have not done enough to create the need for your body to help you grow a bigger chest.\n\nWith the chest workout technique shown here and in this series, you’re going to more quickly tap into these growth inducing type II fibers. The strategy is as follows:\n\nPerform a set of the chest exercises shown below to 12 rep failure. Choose a weight that will cause you to fail at or close to the 12 rep mark. This is called the ignition set. At this point, the real work begins. Rest for just 15 seconds as part of a somewhat prolonged rest/pause. As soon as these 15 seconds are up, get back into another set. You will instantly recognize that the reps will be challenging more quickly due to the decreased recovery time allowed. \n\nYou are still using the same load however, therefore your chest is still being subjected to the same external load. However many reps you get after each of these rest/pause increments are all deemed to be effective reps. Each bout should be taken to failure. Accumulate 20 effective reps, even if you’re getting just 1 out at a time at some point, and your work on that exercise is complete. \n\nIf for some reason you are unable to complete any more reps on your way to 20, end your set and aim to complete all 20 the next time you perform this workout.\n\nHere is how to construct the 100 chest workout with that in mind.\n\n- DB Bench Press - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n- Cable Crossovers - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n- DB Thumbs Up Incline Bench Press - Ignition Set then 20 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause \n- Weighted Dips - Ignition Set then 10 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause as a Pause Dip\n- Omni Crossovers - Ignition Set then 15 Effective Reps as a Rest/Pause with each arm in high position\n\nOptional: Static Hold Pushups x 20 reps using a 5 second isometric hold at the bottom of each rep (Rest/Pause)\n\nAll totaled, this will amount to 100 effective reps in this intense chest workout.\n\nIf you have to adjust your weights down as the fatigue mounts, do so accordingly. You are not necessarily using your 12 rep max on an exercise, you are using a weight that will cause you to fail at the 12 rep mark in that given workout. Fatigue accumulating in the later chest exercises of this workout may cause you to have to drop down a bit to make this happen throughout the workout.\n\nThis is just one example of how to apply science to your chest workouts.

        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/330-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nHave you ever wondered which raise is best for bigger shoulders? In this video I am going to show you 4 different versions of the lateral raise to help you determine which one is best for you and your shoulder training. They might look fairly similar, but it’s the details that matter.\n\nFirst, it’s important to know how NOT to perform a lateral raise. In the pursuit of big shoulders, we also need to be conscious of the health of our shoulder joints as well. It would be of no surprise to me if you had heard the tip to “pour the pitcher” when performing lateral raises. That is, at the top of the movement, elevate your pinky above your thumb and put your shoulder into internal rotation. If you are doing this, I am begging you to stop!\n\nBy “pouring the pitcher,” you are putting your shoulder into internal rotation with elevation. This action creates impingement stress within the shoulder joint which can lead to longterm pain and discomfort. For healthier, bigger shoulders, we should be making sure that the thumb is higher than the pinky at the top of the range of motion. This will actually create external rotation which leads to more room for movement within the shoulder capsule.\n\nNow that you know the proper way to perform the lateral raise to avoid shoulder problems, which way is the best for big shoulders: straight arm or bent arm? Well, it comes down to preference, but it’s important to note how you perform each one as well as understanding the strength and resistance curves.\n\nThe straight arm lateral raise will require you to use less weight to perform properly but don’t get discouraged by this. The muscles in your body don’t know the number on weights, but instead simply know the tension that is being applied to them. When it comes to the strength and resistance curves, we know that the shoulder is strongest at the bottom range of motion of the exercise and weakest at the top. We also know that the exercise is easiest at the bottom and hardest at the top, thus the curves don’t overlap. To accommodate for this in your shoulder workout is to shorten the range of motion in the exercise. Perform the raises from the mid-point to the top-end and keep the dumbbell in that smaller range to increase the amount of tension on the middle delt. You can also perform 1.5 reps to accomplish the same thing.\n\nWhat about the bent arm lateral raise? Well, this shoulder exercise allows for you to use a heavier load to create tension since the moment arm is shortened (arm bent vs. arm straight). To find this weight, take your straight arm lateral raise, cut it in half and then add it to whatever weight you were using for that exercise. For example, if your SALR weight is 20 lb, your BALR would be 30 lb (this is all dependent on limb length and other anatomical features, but maintains a general guideline). \n\nWhen performing the bent arm lateral raise, something that we need to take note of is the introduction of a second lever that is now in the sagittal plane. This heavier weight will want to bring your forearm down to the ground, creating an opportunity for impingement and a greater recruitment of the front delt. Obviously, when trying to isolate the middle delt as well as keeping your shoulders healthy, this would not be ideal. So, make sure that your thumb is higher than your pinky at the top end of the exercise and try to get your elbow back, so that the dumbbell is more in line with your torso.\n\nAnother version of the lateral raise you can add to your next shoulder workout for bigger shoulders is the cable lateral raise. The straight arm cable lateral raise will again require you to use less weight because of the increased moment arm, but the cable introduces the accommodation for the strength and resistance curves that we explored earlier. The same application goes for the bent arm version of this shoulder exercise where you can use a heavier load. Remember, you still want to avoid internal rotation with elevation, so get those thumbs higher than your pinkies!\n\nSo which lateral raise should you be doing if you want to get big shoulders? Well, I would say any of them would be good to put into your next shoulder workout as they all share the benefits of creating tension in the delts. Remember, it’s not about the amount of weight you can move, but how well you can create tension in the muscles.\n\nIf you are looking for a step-by-step training program that puts the science back in the strength of every exercise we choose, then check out our ATHLEAN-X training programs by heading to the link below.\n\nIf you are looking for more videos on how to get bigger shoulders, be sure to subscribe to this channel via the link below and make sure to turn on your notifications so you never a miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "Intense Ab Workout | 6 Minutes (FOLLOW ALONG!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/329-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMWv\n\nIf you want to develop six pack abs you may think that you have to spend hours a day trying to get one.  That is not the case at all.  If you are able to commit to a consistent but short effort you will be amazed at how much better your abs could look in a short period of time when combined with a focused attention to what you eat as well.\n\nIn this video, I have a short 6 minute ab workout for you to do along with me.  As you will see and feel, an ab workout does not have to be long to be effective.  As a matter of fact, I would probably say that the longer the ab workout goes, the less effective it becomes.  The key to this working is that it is short enough to allow you to do it on a regular basis without having to fight to schedule it into your day.\n\nRemember, the key to getting a six pack is consistency.  Now, don’t think that just because you might be doing the same set of exercises that it is becoming less effective.  It is not.  The choice of ab exercises in this workout is broad enough so as to cover all of the major functions of the abs.  There are bottom up movements that better hit the lower abs.  There are rotational movements that are initiated from the bottom up and the top down to really hit the rotation capabilities of the core muscles.\n\nThere are also top down movements where the shoulders are lifted off of the ground as opposed to the legs, which are situated at the end of the workout to allow you to keep training your abs when they are fatigued.  When there are purposeful ab exercises in your workouts they do not have to be long.\n\nThe point of this video is to give you a follow along ab workout that you can do anywhere.  There are no special pieces of equipment needed to do this.  All you need is your body and some space on the floor.  You might actually need a bit more than that, and that would be a heavy dose of determination to try and resist the burn of these exercises as you do them.  Remember, the pain from ab training is usually only temporary.  As soon as finish the exercise and the lactic acid starts to clear the abdominal muscles, you feel normal again.\n\nSee if you can follow the entire ab workout along with me, resting when I do.  If you need extra rest for some reason, don’t be bashful - take it.  Maybe you can only do 40 seconds of one of the 60 second ab exercises.  That’s ok, do what you can and rest for the remainder of that exercise.  As you get stronger on these you will be able to do the whole thing without extra rest.  Here is the ab workout as follows:\n\nHands Back Raises x 60 seconds\nDrunken Mountain Climbers x 30 seconds\nCross Knee Planks x 60 seconds\nRest 30 seconds\nScissor “V” Ups x 60 seconds\nStarfish Crunch x 30 seconds\nRest 30 seconds\nUpper Circle Crunches (clockwise) x 30 seconds\nUpper Circle Crunches (counter clockwise) x 30 seconds\n\nSo there is an ab workout you can do at home with no equipment that will get you started on getting that six pack you’ve always wanted.  If you want to speed up the process you will want to make sure your diet is in place as well.  If you want a step by step meal plan to get you ripped fast, head to athleanx.com via the link above and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.\n\nFor more ab workout videos that you can follow for a six pack, be sure to subscribe to our channel here on youtube via the link above and be sure to turn on notifications so you never miss when something new is posted.",

        "title": "Stop Doing This Biceps Curl (I’M BEGGING YOU!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/328-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nOf all the biceps curl variations out there, there is one in particular that has seemed to have drawn the ire of some without actually knowing why they feel the way they do. In this video, I’m going to break down the Waiter’s Curl. We’ll take a look at the exercise in regards to its effectiveness as a biceps exercise and specifically, its ability to more efficiently target the long head of the biceps. \n\nLet’s talk about the objections.\n\nFirst, some believe that the waiter’s curl doesn’t have enough supination in order to build bigger biceps. This one is actually just blatantly incorrect. Not only is this biceps exercise being performed from a position of supination but it also allows for active supination during the movement. \n\nIt starts with taking the right grip on the dumbbell. Instead of gripping the sides of the dumbbell you have to be sure that you place your hands and fingers flat against the undersurface of the dumbbell. Push through the pinky side heel of your palm and allow the wrists to bend back as you lift to maximize the supination.\n\nNext, the idea that this is an unnatural or weird exercise is not understood. In fact, biomechanically it is quite similar to the rope curl. It’s also occurring predominantly in a hinge joint that is known for its ability to restrict unnatural motion.\n\nWhen compared to the narrow grip knurling on an EZ Bar, you’ll see that the width is almost the same. Not only is this not dangerous but it also is allowing for an opportunity to increase the engagement of the long head of the biceps, the head of the biceps most known for adding the biceps peak and height.\n\nJeb points out that the range of motion on this biceps curl variation is limited at the bottom of the rep because you can’t comfortably extend the elbows all the way down. This is in fact true. The problem comes from the fact that some will often confuse an exercises range of motion with the range of motion possible at the joint performing the exercise. \n\nThe bottom 20 degrees of a stranding curl are not all that effective for producing overload on the biceps. This is the reason that some will perform a seated barbell curl, which limits the more dominant contribution of the brachialis and brachioradialis in this early range and lets the biceps do more of the work in the range that they naturally want to work in.\n\nIf the contention is made that the line of pull on the biceps is unfavorable, it almost always signals a red flag that not enough knowledge of anatomy and biomechanics led to this assumption. This is because the biceps is actually a two headed muscle with separate attachments (proximally - and technically even in the forearm as well). When a more narrow grip is assumed, the shoulder becomes internally rotated. This positions the tendon of the long head in an actual better line of pull, allowing the performer of the exercise to get better engagement of this often times weaker biceps head.\n\nJeb said he heard that the waiter’s curl creates negative feedback of instability at the shoulder and elbow joint which is easily mistaken for increased biceps tension. My answer? Jesse, I thought you said that Jeb graduated elementary school?\n\nJeb also felt that the exercise could be stressful on the wrists. Indeed it can, if it is does incorrectly. It starts again with grabbing the dumbbell properly and placing the hands right on the undersurface of the dumbbell. From here, you need to allow natural wrist extension as you raise the dumbbell up on every rep. Not only does this improve the effect of the movement but it also provides more wrist stability. Wrist extension is the strongest position for the wrist, not the opposite.\n\nThe assertion that an alternating dumbbell biceps curl is better is like saying that the bench press is better than a crossover. They accomplish different things and hit the muscle differently. I actually ranked the alternating curls as my favorite biceps exercise in the bicep exercises ranked video. Here however, when the goal is to better hit the long head of the biceps - this is a superior choice.\n\nFinally, just because you can load other exercises for biceps more doesn’t mean that you don’t want to perform this one.  Remember, tension is the language of muscles. Finding out more ways than just loading weight on the bar is crucial for maximizing overload and growth in the long run.\n\nIf you’re looking for programs based on real science along with nutrition plans that work to get you lean and ripped without sacrificing normal eating, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the AX program selector via the link below. \n\nIf you want to see an entire ranking of biceps exercises along with getting full bicep workouts, be sure to subscribe to our channel using the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "How to Get a 6 Pack in 4 Minutes a Day (WORKS EVERY TIME!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/327-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you ever wanted to get a 6 pack and wanted to do it quickly, then this is a must watch video. Here I’m showcasing what Japanese social media influencer Hiiragi Sensei did to get impressive abs and build more muscle with just a single 4 minute workout repeated every single day for 5 months. But was it the ab workout he did or something behind the scenes that was responsible for his real results? Let’s break it down.\n\nSo the gameplan for Hiiragi was to perform a basic one exercise workout for 4 minutes in Tabata style. This means that he performs the single exercise for 20 seconds and then rests for 10 seconds every 30 second period. He continues this for a total of 4 minutes. The exercise of choice was the basic burpee. I will say however, that the one that he called a burpee was actually not quite a burpee. The removal of the chest to ground requirement of the burpee resulted in him performing a simple squat thrust. This is still a metabolically demanding exercise but not quite as difficult as the full chest to the ground version that he likely should have chosen - particularly if he wanted to build more muscle.\n\nNonetheless, he performed this workout every single day for 5 months.\n\nThere were no days skipped. As his conditioning level improved he was able to do more and more burpees in that same 4 minute workout. He started out getting about 5 reps done in every 20 second period and finished at the end of 5 months with the ability to perform 8 reps every 20 seconds for the entire 4 minutes. This was obviously a form of progressive overload and something that helped him to build more muscle during the period, not just lose the noticeable amount of fat that he did.\n\nIn total, it is claimed that he lost 13.5kg (or 28lbs) in just 150 days.\n\nIf you were to do the math however, you would have to be a little skeptical, as am I. A minute of burpees burns on average about 15-17 calories per minute. Obviously this will vary depending on the size of the individual, the amount of body fat they carry right now and the speed at which they perform the reps.\n\nThe point we are going to highlight is that in a 4 minute workout of just burpees, the most calories he is going to be able to burn is 68. This is the 17 calories per minute for 4 minute calculation I just referred to. Now if you extrapolate that out for 5 months or 150 days you see that in total, he burned around 10,200 calories from the workouts. Divide this by the 3500 that is roughly equal to a pound of body fat and you’ll see that this is only responsible for 3 of the 28 pounds lost.\n\nSo how did he really do it?\n\nThe same way you or anyone else will have to do it if you really want to get a six pack - through diet. There is no way around the fact that the only way to get abs fast is to focus first and foremost on what you’re putting in your mouth. There is no magic 4 minute ab workout that is going to strip away the body fat and give you 6 pack abs. \n\nAs Hiiragai was gaining consistency with his daily workout he was also starting to hold himself more accountable to the process as a whole. No more did he bail on his nutrition and choose bad food selections with reckless abandon. Instead, he started to value the effort and consistency he was putting in with the workouts and was less willing to blow it by eating poorly. With improved quality of food choices and more responsible portions, he was able to really start losing body fat and getting 6 pack abs to show.\n\nIn the end, it was only through the nutrition improvements that he was able to lose 25 of the 28 pounds.  \n\nIf you want to get a 6 pack you will have to learn how to eat smarter.\n\nThat is where my recommendation of something else you can do for 4 minutes comes in.\n\nHead to https://athleanx.com/carbs\n\nBegin by selecting 4-5 starchy carbohydrates that you can’t live without (and shouldn’t be asked to if you want to experience long term success). In my case it would be pasta, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, rice and beans. Then, select as many fibrous carbohydrates as you like. Make sure that you’re not just eating them every meal but eating them in a much higher quantity than the starchy carbs if you want to get six pack abs.\n\nFinally, select your proteins. Be sure to include one at every meal if you want to experience the meal satiety that comes from them and also support muscle growth and repair in the process.\n\nIf you’re looking for a step by step workout that provides you with no-fail daily meal plans as well, be sure to head to athleanx.com and use the program selector tool linked below.

        "title": "Fitness YouTubers Ranked (BEST TO WORST!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/326-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nI think the question that has been asked the most of me during my time on YouTube is which YouTubers do I watch, myself? In this video, I am going to go over the list of the fitness YouTubers (and other YouTubers) that I like to watch in my free time. You might be surprised by some of the people that show up on this list and you may get a little more understanding of who Jeff Cavaliere is outside of ATHLEAN-X.\n\nBefore I kick off this list, I have to disclose that my viewing tastes are not limited just to fitness YouTubers. It may come as a shock that I have other interests as well! Music, motivation, and wrestling to name a few.\n\nTo kick off the list, I have start with someone who has a love and appreciation for science just like I do, and that is Andrew Huberman. A Stanford University researcher who has spent much of his time providing actionable and helpful advice that is all based in scientific reasoning. I find myself learning something new every video that he puts out.\n\nA colleague in the medical field puts out videos where he breaks down high profile sports injuries almost immediately after they happen and offers insight into how and why they occurred and the steps that you, as a viewer, can take to avoid similar injuries. I think Brian Sutterer MD is an excellent resource for understanding injuries for athletes.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I love learning when I watch YouTube videos and I feel like I always have an opportunity to learn when I watch Bright Side. I also like to watch this channel with my sons because I feel like they are learning valuable information outside of the classroom in a fun, engaging style that also lets me learn a little something knew every now and then.\n\nWith a lot of YouTube fitness personalities focused on bringing you exercise tips and workouts, there leaves room for entertainment. I don’t think anyone in the YouTube fitness space is as hilarious or entertaining as Bro-Science Life. Dom Mazzetti has a way of making me laugh with every video that he puts out regardless of how outlandish the content is.\n\nI find that the best form of motivation comes in the form of a kick in the ass from an in your face personality. I don’t think anybody fits that bill better than my friend CT Fletcher. Every time I need that little extra juice in the tank to get going through a workout, all I have to do is turn on one of CT’s videos and I find myself pushing that much harder.\n\nWhile he doesn’t have a YouTube channel himself, it is hard to find a motivational video in the fitness space without hearing him speak. David Goggins is another master motivator that I turn to when I need some extra encouragement to get my head on straight for a workout. When a former Navy SEAL is telling you how to be “hard”, it’s tough not to listen!\n\nWhen it comes to teaching, I have a lot of respect for people that can provide valuable, actionable information that just down right makes sense, especially when it comes to strength training. There are not many out there that do it better than the guys at EliteFTS, but specifically Swede Burns. I just find myself always taking away something new and gravitating towards his teaching style.\n\nBack to entertainment, Harry Mack is someone that I find very engaging. I can’t help but get drawn in by his man-on-the-street approach to his videos, as well as his ability to freestyle using a random collection of words provided by video participants. Every single time I watch, I am impressed!\n\nIt’s hard to argue that the guest list that Joe Rogan has put together over the years isn’t impressive. The diversity of participants means that just about every episode you watch is going to have something new and fresh, with plenty to be learned. I love being exposed to new thoughts and ideas on interesting topics that I may not have considered without watching in the first place.\n\nAs someone who appreciates applied science, I can also appreciate the research that goes into it. I also appreciate when someone is able to read and break down that research for viewers to understand and I think that Jeff Nippard does a great job of this. Making the literature understandable for the viewer is highly valuable when it comes to YouTube fitness.\n\nThere are plenty more YouTube channels on this list that I watch which I cover in the video itself. Who is on your list for people to watch on YouTube? Leave a comment and let me know!\n\nIf you are looking for a step by step workout program where everything is laid out for you without any guesswork, you can find the ATHLEAN-X training system via the link below.\n\nIf you are looking for videos with workout tips and nutrition advice, don’t forget to subscribe to this channel here using the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "How to Target Your Lower Abs (MAKE THEM VISIBLE!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/325-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you have lower belly fat or you are just soft in that area, you might be wondering how to target your lower abs and get visible lower abs. In this video, I am going to show you that not only yes, you can preferentially target the lower abdominal muscles, but how to do so in the most effective way possible. With three simple exercises (plus a bonus exercise) and some tips on how to do them, you will be well on your way to sculpting your lower abs.\n\nYou might have been told that there is no way to isolate one area of the abs over the other. In other words, you cannot work the lower abs without also working the rest of the abdominal muscles. This is true. However, based on where we initiate the movement from, we can preferentially influence the portion of the abs that we are looking for. To target the upper abs, you would perform top-down movements such as a standard crunch, but if you wanted to hit the lower ab muscles, you would perform bottom-up movements. \n\nThe lower abs are subject to another anatomical manipulation and that comes from the position of the pelvis and the low back. To most effectively influence the lower abs, you will want a flat back throughout every ab exercise that you do. To achieve this back position, you are going to need to be in a posterior pelvic tilt. By curling your pelvis in and under, you are also helping to reduce the activation of the hip flexors during these movements.\n\nNext, you are going to want to set your hip angle. Ideally this will be at 90º for both your hips and your knees. However, to make the exercise easier, you will want to bring that angle closer towards your chest and to make it harder, open the angle so that your legs are farther away. Whatever angle you set, make sure to keep that angle throughout the entirety of the exercise.\n\nSo what exercises can we do and how do we do them in order to most effectively target your lower abs?\n\nFirst up, we have swipers. The goal is to get your legs in the air by raising your pelvis completely off the ground and swiping your hands underneath where your butt was. This exercise is great because it has automatic feedback built into the movement. If you successfully curled your pelvis off the ground and towards your chest, you will be able to swipe your hands together no problem. If not, you need to focus on lifting that pelvis.\n\nNext, we have reverse knee tucks, but they should really be called tailbone lifts. Why? Traditionally, most people usually allow their hip flexors to dominate the movement and simply bring their knees towards their abdomen. To really make the lower abs work in this exercise, think about lifting the tailbone off the ground and bringing your knees to about forehead level. This will ensure that you are limiting the amount of work the hip flexors are doing and maximizing the work that the lower abs are performing.\n\nThe next ab exercise is a more dynamic and tougher version of the standard plank called the plank knee slide. By incorporating the same principles that were introduced earlier, you will be effectively targeting the lower abs throughout this movement (if performed correctly, of course). Just make sure you are going slow and deliberate with each part of the movement.\n\nA bonus exercise that is probably one of the most effective ab exercises of all time for hitting the lower abs is the hanging leg raise. Instead of simply raising your legs up, I like to give the cue of showing your butt to the person in front of you. This will disengage the hip flexors and allow the abs to take on the brunt of the work. Another reason this exercise is so great is because you are lifting the weight of your legs against the force of gravity.\n\nTo intensify each of these exercises, simply engage the adductors. On 3 of the 4 ab exercises I showed you, you can simply cross your legs and squeeze them together. On the plank knee slides, think about isometrically dragging the plant foot inwards.\n\nFurthermore, you can also add rotation to the exercises as well since the fibers of the lower abs run at a slightly oblique angle. \n\nNone of this is going to matter if you have too much body fat covering the lower abs themselves. No exercise is going to spot reduce that fat. However, by getting your nutrition in check and being in a hypocaloric state, you will be start burning that fat off while still building and strengthening your lower abs,\n\nIf you are looking for a meal plan where everything is laid out for you step-by-step, we have them included with all of our ATHLEAN-X training programs via the link below.\n\nFor more videos on the best way to sculpt your six pack then you are going to want to subscribe to this channel here on YouTube using the link below.

        "title": "How He Deadlifts 3X His Bodyweight! (THE PLAN)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/324-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nToday, we are talking about Jesse and how he deadlifts 3x his bodyweight. In this video, Jesse and I explain exactly how he was able to progress his deadlift to elite level strength.\n\nThe start of Jesse’s deadlift journey began with fixing his foundation. What this means is working on his postural, mobility, and flexibility limitations, which he was suffering from excessively. Now, I always say that strength is the base of the pyramid, but the root system beneath is stability, mobility, and flexibility which, if compromised, may undermine the entirety of the pyramid. \n\nSpending time fixing Jesse’s posture and other limitations came before even practicing the lift itself allowed him to build a strong foundation to work off of. I feel, as a strength coach and a physical therapist, that by addressing these issues first you will be able to progress through your lifts much quicker and safer.\n\nIf you want a big deadlift, like Jesse; you need to incorporate accessory work to address your weak points. He made use of these exercises to strengthen the weakness he had in each component of the deadlift. The lifts that Jesse made use of included straight arm pushdowns, Romanian deadlifts, high pulls, hip thrusts, lat pulldowns, and power shrugs. These deadlift accessories helped Jesse to get stronger in order to use smaller muscles that were causing him to fail in the first place - especially at lockout. Each one of these exercises, added to his training program, helped Jesse to get a super strong deadlift. \n\nJesse built a strong deadlift by also strengthening his grip. A weak grip can lead to the issue of not being able to hold onto weight that you may otherwise be able to lift without a problem. What he has done to help get a strong grip and a big deadlift was to perform weighted carries often in his training program. Not only that, but Jesse also incorporated dead arm hangs into his routine. Both of these exercises helped Jesse deadlift more than 3x his bodyweight.\n\nSo, what was the programming that Jesse followed to get such a big deadlift? He actually followed one our ATHLEAN-X training programs called Old School Iron. With the first three phases of the program including dedicated strength work, he was able to progress his lifts quick and steady. \n\nThe first phase of Old School Iron followed a 3x5 scheme 1-2x per week, depending on the schedule. Every time the deadlift appeared, Jesse added 5 lbs to his lift. Working on his basic strength foundation and progressing through it in a linear fashion allowed him to add weight to the bar each workout. He actually repeated this phase twice, performing it for a total of 3 times until he noticed his strength gains starting to slow.\n\nMoving onto the second phase, his workouts were based around contrast wave loading, with percentages of the lifts increasing each time they appear. The way this is structured is 5/1/5/1/5/1 - with sets of 5 using 80% of your 1 rep max and the sets of 1 increasing in percentages with each rep and each workout. With a new training stimulus; Jesse was able to experience getting a stronger deadlift as he moved through each workout.\n\nThe third phase of Old School Iron that Jesse performed included a commonly performed scheme of 5x5, something that is often prescribed for getting stronger. While a similar stimulus to the 3x5 training in phase 1, the added volume allowed for increased strength with each workout. This was built into an educated bro split that also had a greater frequency on hypertrophy than the first two phases.\n\nJesse’s training plan was significant in building an elite level deadlift that weighs more than 3x his bodyweight and is available to everyone on the ATHLEAN-X website which I will link below!\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Jesse’s deadlift was the fact that he treated every rep that he performed like it was a one rep max. By utilizing power and explosiveness off the floor and through the deadlift’s lockout, he was able to recruit muscle fibers that grew accustomed to the movement. This allowed for those muscle fibers to get used to the power in order to get stronger with each max lift that he performed. Jesse credits this approach to helping build such a strong deadlift.\n\nIt is worth noting that Jesse was able to get stronger at both the squat and the bench press at the same time by following these points.\n\nIf you are looking for a training program that puts the science back in strength to help you to get bigger and stronger, check out the Old School Iron training program via the link below.\n\nFor more videos on how to get stronger, be sure to subscribe to this channel here by clicking the link below and don’t forget to turn on your notifications so that you never miss a video when we put one out.",

        "title": "I Did HIS Chest Workout (AT HIS GYM!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/323-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want to build a bigger chest then you'll want to use a chest workout that checks all the boxes and delivers the pec gains that you're pursuing. In this video, Jesse from ATHLEAN-X takes me through his chest workout at his gym. For years, these two have been building Jesse up from within the walls of the ATHLEAN X Box. Now, he’s fully grown and ready to roam. See as he takes Jeff Cavaliere through his very own chest workout using machines, dumbbells and even chains.\n\nThis workout for chest starts with the classic dumbbell bench press. After a couple brief warmup sets, the two set out to perform 4 sets for this basic chest building exercise. The first two sets are for 10-12 reps and the last two are heavier, with the goal being 4-5 reps. That is, until Jesse changes the script and makes the last set an AMRAP. Throw a little extra incentive in to the winner and we have the makings of a little bench press competition to raise the stakes even higher.\n\nFrom here, the two move onto the classic pec deck chest fly. Typically, this is an exercise that Jeff doesn’t like. That said, it is much preferred to the unsupported dumbbell chest fly that is performed while laying on a flat bench. The pec deck allows for a safer bottom point, and therefore safer shoulders, than the flat bench dumbbell fly does. \n\nOne of the tips that Jeff shares is that you can rotate your body towards the arm you’re grabbing to make sure that you don’t put any added stress on the anterior shoulder capsule even just getting into the machine. 3 sets of 12-15 reps is what was done to train the adduction of the function of the pecs.\n\nFrom there, we moved onto the cable crossover exercise. This is one of my favorite ways to train chest adduction. By doing this one arm at a time you are able to get a better, more focused contraction on each side and help alleviate any muscle imbalances that may exist. The goal here as always is to keep the chest out in front of the shoulder as you bring the arm across.\n\nIf you lead with your shoulder you will shift too much of the load onto the delts and away from the chest. This is one of the most common chest workout mistakes people make. It takes away a lot of the chest growth that you can achieve by doing a workout for chest. 2-3 sets of each arm for this chest crossover exercise is the next step in this chest workout.\n\nNext, we hit the incline hammer press machine. This is actually a good machine that really helps people to engage their upper chest more effectively. The reason is, that the bench press angle is set to a proper 30 degrees to better engage the upper clavicular fibers better. Also, the machine locking you into the bar path of up and in allows you to really engage the up and in function of the upper pecs. The two load the machine up for 2 sets before moving onto what Jesse calls the “curveball” of the workout.\n\nHere, they break out the chains. A chest dip alone is not enough to finish this chest workout strong. Instead, they do a chest dip chain finisher. Starting with two chains around their neck, they do a set to failure then immediately strip away one chain and do another set to failure. Not quite done however since they take away the final chain and then do a final bodyweight set to failure as the last part of this triple giant set.\n\nWhen you’re in the gym and are looking for a great gym chest workout you have lots of options. Here, you now have an example of a great workout for pecs that can be done with just dumbbells, machines and a few optional chains. Remember, it’s important to perform your sets with an intensity level that challenges you. If you’re looking to build bigger pecs you have to force them to grow. This comes from choosing chest exercises and workouts that challenge them from every angle and every function.\n\nIf you’re looking for a science based workout plan that helps you build a bigger chest and much more, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the ATHLEAN-X workout programs.

        "title": "How to Get WIDER Forearms (WORKS EVERY TIME!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/322-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nIf you want to get wider forearms you have to train the muscles in the forearm that are most responsible for their size. Often times, people fill their forearm workouts with nothing more than wrist curls and reverse wrist curls. This is just not going to cut it when it comes to building wide, muscular forearms. The biggest reason is, this approach doesn’t even account for the muscles of the forearm that have no impact on the motion of the wrist.\n\nIn this video, I’m going to show you the best forearm exercises to build thicker, wider forearms. Most of all, I’ll show you how to focus on the muscles of the forearm that are most easily able to add size and width due to their orientation in the lower arm. \n\nBut first, it’s important that you measure your forearms accurately. In other words, before you look at your skinny wrists and deem your ability to build big forearms as compromised, realize that the muscles of the lower arm become largely just tendons as you get close to the wrist. This means, even if you did all the right things with your workout for forearms, if you had small bones you wouldn’t have large wrists.The good news however is that if you do the right exercises for forearms you will see thicker, wider forearms.\n\nThat said, it’s time to build big forearms the right way.\n\nIf you want to build up the extensor component of the lower arm you need to perform the exercises that work both the ECR or extensor carpi radialis, and the brachioradialis. The irony behind these muscles is that the latter isn’t even technically a forearm muscle. Even more ironic is the fact that the brachioradialis is responsible for the majority of the size of the forearm in the extensor component. It traditionally is viewed as an elbow flexor muscle that works well with the brachialis and biceps.\n\nSo in order to accomplish growth here, you’re going to want to perform an exercise that involves elbow flexion. Ideally, you’ll want to do this from a pronated forearm position. This leads us to the reverse barbell curl. With the pronated arm position, the biceps is most diminished in the exercise, leaving the brachioradialis and brachialis to do more of the work. \n\nThe issue with this exercise is that it can be a tough position for some to  get into due to limited wrist mobility. In this case, the EZ bar variation is ideal. It places the forearm into a less pronated, but still not supinated position that keeps the focus on the brachioradialis. But just doing this exercise for forearms isn’t enough since we can easily incorporate the ECR by just extending the wrists at the top of the rep.\n\nAs far as the range of motion of the reverse curl, there is something you want to consider here as well. First, in the fully lengthened position, the brachioradialis does not have as effective a line of pull as it does when the elbow is partially flexed. So, if you want to target this forearm muscle better, you’ll want to initiate each rep from a partially flexed elbow position. \n\nThe best way to do this is with the bar starting at the waistline and dragging it up the body as if doing a drag curl. This is going to produce an intense contraction in the brachioradialis and ECR all the way through the limited, but more effective range of motion of the rep.\n\nIn order to hit the underside of the forearm and get wider forearms from side to side you’re going to want to also perform another exercise. One of my favorites to do this is with the top down wrist curl. Here you let the cable handle (or band if you’re doing this at home) drift into the ends of your fingers. Start by clenching your hand and making a fist against the resistance of the weight. From here, continue the downward motion by performing a wrist curl.\n\nYou’ll find that by performing this in this way, you get an even more intense contraction than you would from the standard dumbbell wrist curls performed with the forearm resting on a bench.\n\nIf you want to build bigger forearms, the key is knowing which forearm exercises do the best job of targeting the most “space occupying” muscles of the lower arm. With these two moves you have a quick but effective combination that will help you get wider forearms and say goodbye to skinny arms once and for all.\n\nFor a complete program that puts the science into every exercise selection so you can build muscle and burn fat faster, be sure to visit athleanx.com via the link below. \n\nFor more forearm workouts and exercises for bigger forearms, be sure to subscribe to our channel via the link below and remember to turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it’s published.",

        "title": "Your Cardio Machines are LYING To You!",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/321-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nDid you know that your cardio machines are lying to you? In this video, I am going to show you how the cardio machines you are using are incorrectly displaying the number of calories you are burning. In fact, the number of calories displayed may be grossly overestimated. I am also going to show you which machines are the worst at doing this, and which ones you might want to spend your time on instead.\n\nFirst thing is first, if you are using cardio as your main method of creating a caloric deficit to lose weight, you are making a big mistake. The fact of the matter is that nothing is going to be as effective of creating a caloric deficit as keeping your nutrition in check. I talk about it all the time; you can’t outrun a bad diet. Make your caloric cuts through your diet to get the best results when trying to lose weight.\n\nWhere do the inaccuracies sit when it comes to the caloric display? Well, if the machine is not asking you for your weight, it’s already off to a bad start. The cardio machine is calculating the caloric burn based on something called a MET. This unit is multiplied based on the activity, but is calculated using a standard number for weight input; 154 lbs. If your weight is different, then your caloric readout is inaccurate!\n\nThe next way that your cardio machines are lying to you is by fudging the math a little bit. How so? Well, the number displayed is based on including something called the REE; the amount of calories you burn at rest. By including this number, the machine is inflating the number of calories burned. This will make you think that you are burning more calories and doing more work than you actually are.\n\nHow else is are they lying to you? Well, this one comes from something you are likely doing that the machine can’t account for and that is your posture. By leaning over and resting on the handles of a bike or a treadmill, then you are actually unweighting yourself and doing less work. This can actually lead to a 50% difference in the calories you think you are burning. The fix is easy; stand up straight and perform the exercise with good posture.\n\nNext, you have to pay attention to the range of motion when you are performing the work on the cardio machine. You would obviously be performing more work by taking the exercise through the full range of motion as opposed to an abbreviated one. It’s no different when it comes to cardio. On a step mill: taking short, choppy steps instead of driving the foot down and getting to full hip extension. Look at an elliptical machine; it is likely locking you into an abbreviated range of motion based on the design of the machine itself. When it comes to a bike, standing up is how you would be achieving full range of motion while further weighting yourself to perform more work meaning more calories burnt.\n\nSo, what cardio machines are lying to you the least? The stationary bike is the most accurate, overestimating the calories burnt by only 7%. The mathematical equations used to measure force output (watts) in combination with a weight input leads to a more accurate reading. Next up, is the stair master with a 12% overestimation on the calories burnt. Second to last is the treadmill, off by 13-20% which is compounded by the poor posture often included with this machine. Lastly, the most inaccurate of all these machines is the elliptical - a whopping 42%! Some of this is due to discrepancies in the range of motion from machine to machine. \n\nWhat can we do to nullify the inaccuracies of the machines? Well, for starters, we can look to other cardio machines. Which ones we should be focusing our efforts on is based simply on the amount of effort you need to perform them. For example; using an air-bike, a rowing machine, or ski-ERG. They may require more work, but the more work done, the more calories burnt, so these are the best cardio machine options.\n\nIf you want to stick to the machines you are using right now but want to make it more accurate; try to find a machine that asks for you to input your weight to give a reading that is closer to the truth. You can also gauge the work you are doing by your heart rate (the higher it is, the more effort you are expending). Finally, you can take the output the display is reading and cut it in half and use that in your caloric intake guidelines.\n\nDon’t think that your wearable calorie counters are all that accurate either with a 20-96% inaccuracy range!\n\nIf you are looking for a step-by-step training plan that has you burning fat and building muscle at the same time, check out the ATHLEAN-X Training System by clicking on the link below.\n\nIf you are looking for more videos on the best way to burn fat and lose weight, be sure to subscribe to this channel here via the link below and don’t forget to turn on your notifications so you never a miss a video when it’s published.",

        "title": "Glute Exercises Ranked | Hamstrings (BEST TO WORST!)",
        "description": "60% off all AX programs - http://athleanx.com/x/320-workouts\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW\n\nThere are many different glute exercises but today, we are going to rank them so that you know which are worth your time and which ones you should skip. Because the glutes and hamstring muscles share many of the same functions, you are going to get a two for one here as both the glute exercises and hamstring exercises are going to be reviewed and ranked.\n\nWe start as always with the criteria for inclusion on this list. First, these exercises for glutes have to be capable of being overloaded over time. This is key for progressively building muscle. They also by that note have to be capable of delivering hypertrophy and not just strength. Finally, all of these glute exercises have to be safe to perform. As you’ll see, some don’t hold up well to this requirement and are therefore lowered down in the rankings.\n\nWe start as always at the bottom of the list in the worst exercises for glutes category.\n \nFirst up is the prone hamstring curl. Remember, since we are grouping hamstring and glute exercises together due to their shared function, this variation of the curl deserves the lowest spot. It’s not that it isn’t capable of building bigger hamstrings. It’s because it often times brings about low back pain in the process. Especially when there’s a better option to come, this deserve the lowest spot on the list.\n\nNext we have the heel press. This bodyweight glute exercise is one that is limited in both range of motion and overload capacity. There are many better and therefore cannot be ranked highly.\n\nThe Step Mill is one of the most popular forms of cardio, especially for those that are looking to build their butt and do exercises for better glutes. The problem is, the motor is doing all the work. Pass and move onto to a superior alternative later on.\n\nFinally, the leg press (even when performed with the feet high on the plate) is not nearly adequate for delivering glute gains. The range of motion is horrible and the overload is far from optimal. Much better glute exercises await.\n\nIn the better category, we improve on the isolated kickback to this time include some additional weight resistance. The standing cuff kickback is a good way to up your exercises for glutes and deliver better results. The DB reverse sprinter lunge will mimic the position of the chest and thigh that you would see at the bottom of the leg press but do a much better job resisting the extension at the hip on the way up, allowing it to rank deservedly higher.\n\nThe DB single leg RDL is great for exposing right and left leg muscle imbalances but the balance requirements could compromise the hamstring and glute muscle results that you’ll see which leaves it lower on the list.\n\nTaking another step up in the glute exercise rankings into the better still category we find the cable single leg RDL as a slight improvement over the dumbbell because of the added stability we get from it in the frontal plane. The Seated hamstring curl machine is a far better option if you want to use a machine to build bigger legs. The direction of force takes the hip flexors out of the exercise and therefore saves your back. The KB Swing, while an amazingly athletic exercise for glute development can become more of a challenge to your conditioning rather than building bigger glutes.\n\nThe almost best category includes the incredibly powerful squat (this time being recommended in a low bar position for targeting the glutes more effectively), the standard two legged version of the barbell RDL, a leaning forward step up, pull throughs and of course the underutilized glute ham raise. All of these exercises for glutes and hamstrings are capable of delivering stronger bigger glutes and are worth a spot in your glute workout.\n\nFinally, the best of the best glute exercise is the barbell hip thrust. Both the mechanics of the exercise as well as it’s ability to check all three criteria laid out make it the best exercise for glutes. Be sure to watch why for all the details.\n\nMeantime, if you’re looking for a complete program that puts the same science into the selection of all the exercises included (not just glute exercises), be sure to head to athleanx.com via the link below.
